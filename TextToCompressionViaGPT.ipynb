            "I have been following the election race on and off throughout. I especially love watching the debates between candidates. I have to say that I have followed this election race more than I had prior ones. Definitely more entertaining due to Trump and his eccentric and brash point of view. Trump may not have a history in politics but I feel he has a more of a realistic and relatable direction. Trump brings a more outside perspective as opposed to this 'stepford wives' kind of mold politician seem to encompass these days. He challenged his opponents and caught them off guard at times. Trump is not afraid to speak up and challenge. Now with that being said he may tend to stick his foot in his mouth at times and say completely racist comments I sometimes find myself torn between cringing and somewhat applauding him for not holding back and just unleashing.\n",
            "I spoke with my husband and he and I see eye to eye with this whole campaign/election. He believes Mr. Trump has been very uncivil throughout, lots of name calling, lies and being downright mean. He also said that he found Mrs. Clinton's campaign to be very arrogant, anyone who disagrees with her on an issue must be an idiot. My husband also does not plan to vote for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. Our faith didn't play a huge roll in this particular conversation. Though I know our faith has led us to believe we cannot support either candidate from a moral standpoint. Just today my husband quoted C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity) in reference to being unable to support either candidate. \"I feel a strong desire to tell you--and I expect you feel a strong desire to tell me--which of these two errors is the worse. That is the devil getting at us. He always sends errors into the world in pairs--pairs of opposites. And he always encourages us to spend a lot of time thinking about which is the worse. You see why, of course? He relies on your extra dislike of the one error to draw you gradually into the opposite one. But do not let us be fooled. We have to keep our eyes on the goal and go straight through between both errors. We have no other concern than that with either of them.\"\n"

This could just as easily be turned on Christians. But I don't think there's any justification to blame Trump for not wanting America to help these refuges. Our country isn't capable of solving all of the world's problems. What should happen is churches and private citizens should support international organizations that can help these people. Trump should call on people to do that instead of focusing on banning a group of religious people. I would still side with Trump for at least wanting to get immigration under control in some form.

There should not be an expectation that we will provide all of their needs.  There should be programs to help them get established and we should give them a period of time to accomplish this.', 'While I understand we do have an immigration problem, splitting up families is no way to fix it. The logistics alone make his plan nearly impossible. Not to mention we were founded as a country to house people looking for a better life. Why should we deny that to so many people who have struggled to get here? Since these people are already here, why not create a path to citizenship for them, so that they can become full members of society who will be able to pay taxes.', 'Mexicans and other immigrants are not ruining our economy. Fat and lazy Americans that need to go to the hospital and/or pop 5 pills a day are. The best workers are Koreans, Mexicans, Chinese, Africans etc. I have friends from all of these backgrounds and I value them tremendously. It is not necessarily the fat Americans faults because the food system is corrupt and formed on greed rather than the needs of the people.

Also, look into the reasons why so many people find it necessary to enter this country illegally. (Female)\", 'It is sad that families who are Christians would be deported but unfortunately, they have been breaking the law while they were here.  God expects us to abide by the laws that He has set in place through governments to govern us.  Undocumented workers came here illegally and broke the law.  If they were Christians before they came, they were in disobedience to God and this is sin.  And, sometimes we face horrible consequences as believers because of our sin.

Our country was established by immigrants.  Aside from Native Americans virtually everyone who came to the United States were from other countries.  They were looking for religious freedom and an opportunity to begin a better life.  Many had been persecuted for their religious beliefs and were not willing to abandon those principles so starting a new life in a new land was an attractive option.  Trump’s unmerciful stance on refugee and immigrants goes against every aspect of the principles our country was founded upon.  I don’t believe we should just open the floodgate for immigrants and refugees to come to America without proper documentation and screening.  However, to say they can’t flee a war torn country to look for a better life because of religion is wrong.

The Rome like family came here legally from Germany because it is against the law to homeschool your children in Germany.  They could not accept the secular education their children would be exposed to in Germany.  The Obama administration fought to have them deported where if the Romeikes did not send their children to public school, then they would have been removed from their Christian biological parents' home.  I understand why you think we should open our country to refugees and I especially agree with you that we should accept Christian refugees fleeing prosecution.  Trump is not against this.  He is in support of slowing down the acceptance of refugees from areas of known Islamic terrorists who are not Christians until we have in place a better means to vet them before we allow them in.

He also has mocked disabled people and insulted them. He seems to not respect Muslim refugees and wants to ban them from entering the United States. He also wants to deport undocumented immigrants, who have young children that are citizens. Donald Trump is pretty much against whatever America stands for.', 'I’m not concerned the immigrants. We live in a world of diverse backgrounds. I don’t think that impacts my decision on voting for him or not', \"All the statements about immigrants and refugees don't bother me at all because I understand what he's trying to say in his messages. I receive those statements and concerns in a positive manner. I see Trump as a man trying to protect his country first before being able to outreach his support and concerns to other countries. I think he's absolutely correct in his statements that we need to protect our own citizens including our Mexican Syrian citizens because they are the ones with the rights to be here not the undocumented. I'm married to a Mexican man and his entire Mexican family have the same beliefs. Their families came here legally and learned the language from TV shows and schooling that why shouldn't other people. Which is what Trump is trying to get across. If we all went about coming in to this country the legal and right way, there is no issue. We are simply trying to protect our citizens before we can outreach a hand to other countries. There are plenty of private funded organizations that work towards protecting and helping citizens and other impoverished people, I just don't believe our government should be involved in helping them first before our citizens because our country needs a lot of help itself before we can go around helping others with them assuming we are doing fine on the inside. Especially since our education system in particular is so destructive.\", 'Although I would never be deported or forcefully separated from my family I can’t even begin to imagine what sort of emotional pain that would cause. Separating mothers from their children because they are illegal immigrants is terrible. They came here seeking a better life for their families and he wants to take that away?

In fact, I believe that divorced couples should be welcomed back into the church without having to go through an expensive annulment that is required only for money making purposes. Although I feel compassion and sympathy for immigrants and refugees, I think there should be quantitative limits on both. Illegal immigrants impact our economy/crime/employment/health benefits, etc. negatively in a number of ways. At times I wonder why some of our citizens are in such hopeless and dire circumstances as compared to the immigrant population.  As for refugees, it should be a requirement and responsibility for other nations to also share the burden of taking in refugees too.  Other countries need to step up and allow refugees to enter their country for sanctuary too.  I think that Trump has valid concerns over the safety and security of our country.  Yes, we should help those in need but we also need to protect the rights and safety of our own citizens first before allowing others to enter our country when we are not sure of their intent, terrorist associations or origin.

I don’t believe he is persecuting people exclusivity because of their religious beliefs with regards to entering the united states ... He does however have other immigration bias', 'The statement about the disabled reporter is probably the least concerning, although they all concern me to a point. We do need to treat the disabled with respect and dignity but I feel there are a lot more people in this country claiming disabled that find some little thing to claim disability and they take advantage of the system. This is not to put down those who are truly disabled, but often the disabled do more to support themselves in society than many who claim disability.', \"I'm less concerned by Trumps comments about Muslims, since I think this is an issue that needs to be addressed.

Of course the Pope speaks on compassion and forgiveness. We are taught to love the sinner but hate the sin. He should never have made comments on Trump's statement about building a wall because it has nothing to do with blocking out potential new citizens and everything on protecting the ones we have. It's about keeping illegals from taking advantage of opportunities from our citizens and having access to a country's benefits without the individual having to make the sacrifice of leaving their country to claim the US as their own. While there are thousands of people from countries not bordering the US who are on a waiting list to become a US citizen and here are Mexicans and other nationalities jumping or borders taking the spots of those hard earned immigrants who have an ocean and fees blocking their way.\", 'He makes valid points in the video.

When the Pope visited Philadelphia where I reside, a huge fence and walled structure was erected to keep the area secure. There were so many people that missed the Mass on the Parkway because they were held up in security lines because they couldn't get past the guarded fences. The wealth of the Vatican is so large that third world countries could be continuously fed if the grandeur and splendor of wealth would be sold and turned into revenue to fund poor villages with food.\", \"They all have legitimate claims against him.

The specific religion is important to me because I want to vote for a candidate that represents my values accurately and someone who is a reformed protestant evangelical should generally reflect my views more than anyone else. (Male)', \"I don't think a candidate's faith or lack thereof plays much of a role at all in who I decide to support. For example, let's say that one candidate was a Protestant Christian, and the other was an atheist. I myself am a Protestant Christian. However, if I agreed more with the political stances of the candidate who happened to be atheist, and I thought they would be a better leader, I would vote for him or her over the candidate who shares my own faith. I don't see the President as needing to be an advocate for my religion. I believe that God is powerful enough that He does not need the President of the US to carry out His will on earth. The same logic extends to voting for candidates outside of my specific religion. I would sooner vote for a Muslim who I believed would be a good leader than vote for a Christian who I thought would be a poor leader.

Any person can be religious. Religion can be taken on and off, like a pair of socks. Faith is a part of who you are and shapes your integrity.

Yea it would be great if they are also but not a deal breaker.

They may as well NOT pretend.  Pretending is offensive.  They are secular and I can deal with that.  I feel more comfortable with a secular president.

Religion is an organized set of rules to practice worship. That said, it is not important to me that the candidates are \"religious\" but I would like for them to have faith in God.  It\\'s not a bad thing to have a president that makes decisions on what he thought Jesus might do.', 'I would definitely vote a real Christian over a fake or one who has no faith.

While only God can judge the heart of the candidate, I would prefer the candidate demonstrate that they are of the Christian faith.  This is important because of the nomination of Supreme Court justices.  I want our country to be led by a candidate whose personal relationship with Jesus will shape their actions and decisions.  However, if neither candidate stands out strongly in their faith, I will vote based on the candidate who appears to be the most conservative in their social beliefs.', \"Faith is important to me because of Israel, if we don't keep them as allies then God would turn his back on us.  They are the chosen people.  I also believe that it is important that the president prays for our nation also.\", 'If they are not a person of faith, they may not be inclined to be moral and ethical in their decisions.', 'I think if a person is of faith they tend to be more conservative with their views. If they are not a person of faith, I think they make decisions more quickly without thinking them through.', 'I think that if the President is a person of faith, then they will be guided by their faith when making decisions and their values that they were taught through their religion. If they are not of faith, then they will make decisions solely based on logical outcomes. It would make a difference to me if they are not of faith because then I do not know whether they will apply the same care and weight to decisions that I do, such as abortion and ending lives.

But then I have seen many faithful people fall from grace. While faith shapes a person’s beliefs, it’s the integrity of the person's character that makes the person. I believe that you can have integrity and not be faithful, just as a person can be extremely faithful and have no integrity.\", 'I believe most people of faith have strong convictions.

If you mean that they faithfully practice their religion, then I think that is a good quality in anybody, not just a President.

What form of faith would you want to see or hear from the candidates that would reassure you?] I don't see religion as playing a role in politics. Being a good person with integrity is important. Being able to behave in honest and respectful ways is important. Having faith in yourself and what you stand for is important.

I do believe that God can and does bless people that follow Him. I would like for our nation to be among those people again. (Male)', \"I don't think it makes much of a difference if the President is a person of faith. I think a person doesn't necessarily have to believe in any sort of faith to be a good person or a good leader.

This parable was totally on target with issue of immigration.  Even the priest, who is assumed to be a Christian, avoided the man in need.  The Samaritan not only helped the man immediately but also came back to check on him.  This act of mercy shown by the Good Samaritan is one that should be exhibited to all people. Our priests have not talked about any aspect of the candidates thus far.  However, in previous elections they have discussed the issues and expressed the Church’s stand on those issues.  There has never been a candidate openly supported.  Local candidates have been invited to speak in group gatherings outside or regular church services but still not openly supported by the priests.', \"I did attend services and the priest spoke about current race relations and recent tragedies that are occurring in our society.

The focus was on accepting all people without segregating them by distinction. Although I feel that political ramifications of treating everyone in a neighborly fashion when it comes to immigration and sexual tolerance/orientation is left up to interpretation that really neither political party really embodies the true spirit of the gospels. Politics is a dirty business that serves greed with lobbyists and political power when considering the true human needs of refugees/immigrants that are intermixed with radical based jihadist groups that advocate terrorism at all costs. Religion helps to inspire us to think about how to treat others yet evil still exists.  We continuously ask why do tragic things occur yet our politicians can't come to agreement on banning assault weapons. Nevertheless, I was left with an uplifted feeling that there is always hope if we accept others and treat others fairly.

I do not take every word of the priests, bishops and Pope to be the final factor.  I weigh their advice and comments against logic and my instinctive value system.

Does this candidate have the ability to be merciful and loving? Do they show compassion? Or do they boast and put down others? It has made a good impact on me. God loves in more ways than we can count. God is kind and gentle yet fierce and just. If we try to just live a life of compassion and understanding, we can create stronger bonds.

Since the study did not ask specifically about personality, how has your changed over time?] We study through the Bible about God's love/sacrifice, prophecy, and commandments.

It was a very challenging sermon since I live in an area of the country and attend a church that is predominantly white like me.  It was also good because he gave suggestions on how we can raise our children to not view the world in terms of race.  Our pastor did not speak directly on how this relates to the upcoming election or in regards to any candidates but it did make me personally think about how the candidates would or would not be able to bring unity back to our country. Our pastors do briefly mention the Presidential race at times but it is more in passing than giving us specific advice or information in regards to the candidates.  They tend to focus more on how we live in a broken world and no politician alone can change that.  Instead, our country needs revival and more of a return to following and sharing God's Word.  They believe that much of the turmoil in society is an opportunity for us to share the Gospel with those individuals and our pastors challenge us not to be discouraged by these times of uncertainty in our country but to firmly anchor our hope and faith in Jesus Christ.

When someone calls themselves a Christian, then behaves in a way that is confusing to those who aren't, it directly reflects on the rest of us, and we are forced to defend our own faith.\", \"The pastors handled it well and didn't race to judge Trump. They all want what is best for our nation and for Trump personally. They had responses I want from respected Christians.

We aren't called to judge everyone, but we are called to hold fellow Christians accountable.\", 'I felt relieved that I did not attend their churches.

While he is making mistakes and refuses to admit his need for repentance, he is not a practiced politician.  This does not make his words acceptable but does seem to explain at times how he lacks self-control.  I felt Max Lucado's points were particularly good in relation to how if Trump is a Christian he should not be saying some of the things he does.  I pray if he has accepted Christ he will begin to feel the leading and convicting of the Holy Spirit to have more self-control and more poise in speaking.  The last pastor's argument was weak in my opinion.  Do we need to reach out to Muslims and share the gospel? Of course! However, we do have to recognize almost all terrorist activity in our country in the past 15 years is contributed to the Islam faith.  We must have in place the means to protect our country and our citizens even if it includes a temporary ban on accepting Muslims until we can appropriately screen to the best of our ability their intentions upon entering our country. [What in your opinion is the best way to communicate that we need to reach to Muslims, but still protect the country? How should this be done that would be favored by those who have the same beliefs as yours?] Our church is actively involved in sending missionaries to Muslim countries and this practice needs to continue.  We also reach out to the Muslims who are here in the United States by befriending them, getting to know them, and understanding their culture but letting them know almost immediately we believe in Jesus. I think we protect the country by a thorough screening process before allowing any Muslim enter the country and more consistent enforcement of the immigration policies we have in regard to overstayed VISAs and green cards.  I am not saying we never allow Muslims in our country again but I do think we have to accept that the vast majority of terrorist attacks are perpetrated by Muslims.  Once the President sees a plan in place to adequately and thoroughly screen then we can begin the process of allowing Muslims to enter our country\", \"I respect Max Lucado and I agree with what he said---if Trump didn't call himself a Christian, his behavior would not be something that we could hold him accountable for.\", \"The one that stood out was the one who said his prayer for Trump is that he would repent of his sins and come to Christ. Also, I would have doubts to the Christianity of the one who said Trump should not ban Muslims. Muslims are not Christian, they don't worship the same God and just because they are fleeing because of their religion it is not the same as when the Pilgrims came to America. [How do you believe the message about Muslim could have been communicated better?] How do you believe the message about Muslim could have been communicated better?\", \"I thought each pastor had valid points. Max Lucado had valuable words, pointing out he wouldn't be commenting if Trump hadn't spoken out about being a Christian, but without living his daily life as one. I appreciated the speaker in the end pointing this is not a Democratic or Republican issue, but a moral one.\", \"I liked the pastors that spoke on the video.  Trump saying, he never makes mistakes yet they showed all of his mistakes that he made on the video directly out of the horse’s mouth. I really liked the 2nd pastor because he said that if Trump didn't say he was a Christian then he wouldn't be saying anything.  That really stood out for me.  That he felt so strongly about that, as well do I.\", \"I feel the same way about him. He seems to see himself as deity, that he can't do anything wrong. He says he's a Christian, but has no qualities of a Christian. Christianity is about grace. We are all sinners. Every one of us. Christianity says that when we come to God, and accept the gift we have been given, the perfect blood sacrifice for atonement for our sins, that God sees us as white as snow. He has thrown our sins as far as the East is from the West. He shows grace. But we have to accept that we are indeed sinners to accept that perfect gift.

Max Lucado is an author, but who were the other two. What religion do they represent? [Who do you think the other two leaders represented? How much information would you need? How does this affect your feelings towards the video?] I have no idea on the first one, but maybe the 3rd one was Muslim since he was defending Muslims. I know there are many religions, but I believe in only one God. Any religion that does not believe in the one true God who gave his Son Jesus to die for our sins and was resurrected is not a Christian religion. There are many denominations that believe the Bible and worship the God of the Bible. If these other 2 men were not from a Christian denomination, then what they say does not agree with what I believe. I would need to know if these 2 men are Christian and if they serve the same God of the Bible as I do. Muslims do not.', 'Bible verses they stick with you.

[If the last person was a Muslim, how would this change your opinion about the video?] If you are trying to prove Trump is not Christian by using religious leaders, then those leaders should also be Christian. Muslims do not worship the God of Christianity, therefore if he is Muslim he may be a religious leader but he is not a Christian leader and is not in a position to determine whether Trump is or is not a Christian', 'I will be more aware of the election as it continues; and how issues directly relate to Catholic doctrine.', 'I am very grateful to be a part of this project as it has reminded me how much religion actually plays a part in politics.', 'I will continue to think about in what ways those in leadership should be reflecting the light of Christ.

I have watched almost all of the presidential debates and even parts of some of the town hall meetings. (Male)', \"I know basic things that are going on and pay attention to the hot topics that the media tends to cover, but I don't necessarily do my own research into the candidates. I'm not huge on politics, so I usually just find a couple of issues that are important to me and see what they have to say about those. (Female)\", '[How do you think you will follow the political exchanges as the election nears? Do you plan to vote?] I will continue to follow the debates and the stands of the two candidates and I do plan on voting. I am an avid supporter of voting rights.

(Male)\", \"Well I haven't followed the election as closely as I probably should, I’m more invested than I’ve been in past elections. My main motivation has been my surprise in the way that it has gone. Especially given the fact that Trump ended up getting the Republican nomination. I really thought he would not be in it long enough to do that. Most of my following of this election has been due to shock and entertainment. (Female)\", \"[What makes you more invested this year than in previous elections?]  The main reason is this is only the second election I've actually been able to vote in. The first one I was only 18 and not that invested in the world around me in general.  Now that I'm older and have children of my own, I see the value in knowing about politics and trying to make an informative voting decision.\", 'I have been following it pretty closely. I try to watch a couple different news networks at least a few times a week to try and get both sides of the story. I certainly am paying much more attention than I ever have before. I am paying such close attention because I feel that this is a particularly important election. I feel as if our country is at a divisive moment and the next president will affect how where the path leads us. (Male)', 'Very closely for a handful of reasons. The first and most important reason is that this is the first election I will get to vote in, and I believe it is my duty as a citizen of a Democratic Republic to not waste the opportunity to vote. Second, it is helpful in many of my classes and extra credit assignments to know what is going on in the world. Third, I have serious concerns about a number of social issues our country is facing at the moment. (Male)', \"I would say that I have followed the presidential election fairly closely so far. I have been interested in politics ever since the 2008 Presidential election when I was in high school. I followed the 2012 Presidential election very closely, and as an extension, I have kept up with the 2016 Presidential election as well. The political process is interesting to me, and I think many issues in foreign and domestic policy are very important in today's world, and both of these have led me to follow politics. (Male)\", 'yes! I have and I would have to say I followed it very closely during the primary season I follow it now but not as diligently since the presidential nominees are established but I am looking forward to viewing during the conventions', \"I have followed it somewhat, but not as closely as I have other Presidential elections. This is partly because the candidates don't interest me and I find it difficult to respect them.\", \"The election is so very important but I've had a hard time following this one. I really don't like either of them. Trump is the closest to my ideals. Sometimes the things they both say really upset me.\", 'I have not been following it real closely. I never do. Right now there is so much bashing other candidates and political \"stuff\" going on. I chose to ignore all of it. Then when it gets closer to election time and I know who the candidates are I will do my own in depth research on each candidate and try to tune out all the \"lies\" so I can make an informed decision of who to vote for.', 'I have not paid very much attention for the past several months, but that is changing.  I feel the primaries were a joke.  I have been reading articles lately on Donald Trump and I am amazing how hated he is in the media and among his own party.  This \"hate\" is only helping him, as it shows what an outsider he is.  So, now, I closely evaluate each article as to its source, as there is no objective media and everyone has an agenda.', 'I have been mostly just seeing campaign ads on tv, Internet ads and often it comes up in discussions after church or while hanging out with friends.', \"At first I was just basically holding my breath for the primaries because it wasn't clear which of republicans would make the cut and my first choices didn't make it.\", \"Then I kind of held my breath because I really didn't want to see Hillary Clinton win and I thought maybe she might be held back because of her violations of email policies etc., but unfortunately, for us, it hasn't seemed to affect her race.\", \"I have been watching this campaign. As I really don't like either one of them all that much I am more swaying forwards Clinton.\", \"this is the first time in my life that I have followed the election so closely. I always just voted democrat at every election except this year. I am so sick of a government who doesn't care about the people. In my opinion they are all corrupt and waste our tax money on things we the people would never spend on. we are so far in debt now that'll it will take a genius to get us out.\", \"I haven't been following as closely as previous elections.  I am honestly waiting until everything is final and we are down to the front runners.  With social media it's hard to pick out the truth from everyone's perception, so I figure I will research more closely when it gets closer to the time to vote.\", 'Very Closely is how I have been following this year’s presidential election. I care greatly that a slimy liar like Hillary Clinton is NOT elected. I am an army vet who was stationed in Bangkok during the fall of Saigon and I CANNOT imagine how I would have felt had my country abandoned me the way Clinton turned her back on the requests for security and help from our people in Benghazi. Her campaign funds come from the same people who are terrorists and trying to kill us. She is evil. I don\\'t like Trump either, but he did not turn his back on his country and take “donations\" from all sorts of terrorist organizations.', 'I follow the election process each time, but this year has been terrible. I have always been a fan of Mike Huckabee, but he is too conservative to win. Our country has become so divided and the insults hurled from both sides have been brutal. I have never been a fan of Obama, but I was raised to respect whoever was put in charge of our country.', \"I am definitely not a fan of Trump and cannot believe he is going to be the Republican nominee. I had started to hear more about Kasich and become a fan of his, but by then it was too late. The media had made it all about Trump and we weren't hearing much about the other candidates.\", \"[How are you following closely? What are you looking at and what are you looking for?] I followed the election a lot closer earlier in the year before the primary in my state. Now that there are 2 presumptive nominees, I haven't been following it as closely.\", \"I follow politics even during non-presidential election years and feel it is important to be informed.  I consider myself a conservative first then a Republican.  I listen to a lot of conservative talk radio and watched at least 75% of the Republican primary debates.  I feel it is important to be informed so I could make the decision I felt was best when voting in the primaries. I haven't been following it a ton. I'm not a fan of either of the two leading candidates and as they each emerged as the forerunner of their respective political parties my interest waned. Our town did host both of them, so that was exciting even if you don't support them, it's nice to see them locally.\", \"I normally don't follow the election at all.  But this year I'm kind of not really following it.  The reason being the people who are running.\", 'agine you could write a short note to the Presidential candidates, to tell them how you will be making up your mind and how they can earn your vote.

This means helping the minorities, the lower classes, the children who cannot yet vote, the people who cannot afford to help pay for your campaigns, and even the people who voted against you.  America cannot survive if just one type of person is catered to.  Be those the rich people, the majority, the politicians, the oil companies, or the executives.  None of these people, by themselves, can help America survive.  Can you HONESTLY say that you are working for all Americans despite any differences in class, color, religion, or opinion?  If not, then you are not fit to serve as the leader of ALL of America.', \"Dear Candidate, my vote will be determined by how honest I feel you are. Please remember you are to become our leader and we need to rely on you. No offense to the 3rd party guy because he doesn't stand a chance so I'll just focus on Donald and Hillary. Hillary, you are a legit criminal and I have no clue how you are still not behind bars. Your pockets run deep with favors and monies owed and it'll interesting to see how you pay those off because I'm still boggled as to how you got so far. Speaking as a woman you definitely aren't getting the fem power from me. You wouldn't be able to ever get my vote because I don't think you could ever have a clear conscience. Donald, you are a very blunt man. But you've done your research or at least paid someone to do it because you know exactly how to create such a powerful image or both positivity and negativity but you do it all on your own dime which is great, thanks for that. You have a lot of extreme ideas that provoke a lot in people. I love to discuss the immigration one because I actually grew up in a border town close to the AZ/Mexican border and I do have to admit it's scary as a youth running into an illegal in the desert, especially when you don't know any Spanish. I'd love to give you some firsthand insight of that if you're interested. I'd like to let you know that you scare me as well. You do a lot of bold and run around talking and lack compassion, at least I've never seen any on any regard. Even though you are a forceful man, you've been supporting yourself on your own dime and I do enjoy your political incorrectness and putting politicians in their place so you will definitely get my vote versus Hillary.\", 'I would ask Mr. Trump that since I have not made up my mind on who to vote for could he please give me a concrete plan on what he plans on doing with the over spending of the government such as welfare and the military. I would want to know what his plans are for Obama Care and the environment. I would ask Ms. Clinton what she also plans on doing with Obama Care and the environment.

When I ask you what you stand for I expect a full answer and not a roundabout answer that doesn\\'t really answer my question. I expect you to tell the truth and not lie to me just to earn my vote. I expect that you focus on earning my vote by appealing to the values I stand for. If you cannot appeal to the values of quality human life, no abortion, and helping our country vs. helping others first, then you can earn my vote.

It's okay to have a difference of opinion, because that's what differentiates the parties.  But it's a hard pill to swallow when you are given to candidates that genuinely seem to hate each other.  I always admire when I see past presidents, from both parties, converge together for a cause, and they warmly greet each other.  But it seems those days are gone.  Contentiousness is not attractive on anyone.  Please make it easier for not just me to vote, but for all of us.\", 'The best way to earn my vote is by showing me honesty.

I am tired of hearing the same old promises presidents before you and the presidents before them and the presidents before them have blindly to America and will continue to do so because you feel that will be enough.

Be wholly pro-woman (safe abortions when medically necessary, counseling and financial aid when not) and concerned for the general welfare of the entire population not just the richest. How about some real healthcare options so cancer patients can live a semblance of a normal life instead of being up to their eyebrows in debt? If you want my vote, then you also need to be sincerely concerned about religious prejudice in this country.', 'Neither of the two current candidates deserve the office one is a hate filled race monger and the other is one of the most corrupt individuals to run for office in the history of this country. In my letter would state that the open and honest truth about all aspects of the current investigation need to be out in the public and that the foreign donations that are currently being funneled in to the organization in exchange for favors needs to stop com0letly with laws put.in place so that they are no longer able to accept foreign donations for any reason.

For the democratic candidate, I would tell them there is absolutely no chance that they would get my vote, no matter what they say.  An often cited quote, attributed to many different individuals, goes something like this, \"If you are not a liberal at 25, you have no heart.  If you are not a conservative at 35, you have no brain.\"  This fits me exceptionally well.  But that is not to say I will blindly vote conservative.  To the republican candidate (presumably Trump), I would say that he needs to be careful what he says and how he is portrayed in the media.  This election will be won or lost less by facts and more by public opinion.  I would be just fine casting my vote for a third-party candidate. (Male)', 'For Hillary Clinton, I would tell her there\\'s basically nothing she can do to earn my vote. I am sick of the scandals that follow her and her family. I would really rather have Bill for another term than her because I find truly disgusting her apparent entitlement to the \"throne.\" I am disgusted in particular by her advocacy of \"women\\'s rights,\" which I disagree with morally, but which I also find hypocritical in her since she has allied herself with Bill as he victimized women. I find her actions in the Benghazi matter horrible. For Donald Trump, who I am almost certainly going to vote for, though I do have reservations (ie he seems tyrannical), I would like to see him follow through on putting an end to illegal immigration (not singling out banning Muslims or a religious group though--that sets a bad precedent). I\\'d like to see no foreign wars and empire building. In his case, I would really be comforted and made comfortable to vote for him knowing that he would refrain from all of the executive actions and orders that Obama (in a precedent starting with Bush) isn\\'t afraid to use.

I will see how he or she handles pressures or stressors, etc. (Male)', '[What do you mean by fall in line?] Meaning that if we have similar beliefs, then the candidate could potentially secure my vote.', \"The most important thing to me for a presidential candidate is not your views, but it is your character.

Sincerely, Jessica (Female)', 'I am honestly not sure what I would say to Hilary. I just know that for her to have any chance at earning my vote she would have to convince me that she is not as corrupt as I believe her to be.

We need a better minimum wage, please!', 'Dear Presidential Candidates, this is anonymous so I will tell you up front; neither of you whether republican or democrat are my first choice, or even second choice, so from the beginning of your candidacy, I have very mixed feelings. Neither of you seem to have the moral, ethical, or spiritual fiber that I would hope for in a president. While you both may have a certain amount of life and legal experience, neither one of you has the clear outward \"presidential persona\" that seems to be helpful to be a world leader. Neither one of you have my confidence that you will make the best decisions for our country philosophically, regarding government or military situations. Neither of you speak of your own personal faith or any personal struggles and how you have dealt with them morally or spiritually. You both seem to lack humility and contrition whenever you have screwed up. You may have said you were sorry or apologized but the sincerity was little more than what you get when two 8yr olds in a school yard scuffled are forced to shake hands and \" say you\\'re sorry\". I just don\\'t know what to think. I could say Hillary, you have had the experience of being in the white house already, but your husband was a disgrace to the presidency and you would have done well to divorce him and separate yourself from him, but instead, you stood by him, only to be able to emotionally blackmailing him into getting his cronies to eventually support your campaign, if not flat out BUY your campaign. I would have way more respect for you if you had left him and then your platform would be significant as the first woman presidential candidate, but since you didn\\'t, I see a vote for you as a continuation of the presidency of Bill Clinton, Liar, Adulterer and public disgrace to the White House, the Office of the presidency of the USA and to our country and everything it stands for. To you Donald Trump, I know your \"comb over \" is your trademark, but it looks ridiculous and is not the \" presidential look\" I would hope for in someone who lacks actual political experience but who now seems to really want to win the presidential race. So now I have to explain, when you first announced your name was going in the hat for this race, we (I) thought it was a joke. We figured you had enough expendable money to get in and \"stir the pot\" like Russ Perot did several years ago and get the other candidates talking about the issues etc. We never really believed you were serious...I mean who wears their hair like a middle aged has been used car salesman? We could say well you have a lot of business experience, because of your successful business status, but wait.... how many times have you filed bankruptcy? You may call it business strategy, but to file ch 13 so many times for the same business no less, is shameful to me. Then there\\'s the issue of marriage, yes you believe in it (at least 4 times) but you also seem to believe in divorce equally or almost equally as much (if statistics are to be trusted, you will probably divorce wife #3 or is it #4 as well. Do you have a moral compass? If not, when and how will you get one? Or will you hire a committee and borrow theirs? It would be nice to know more about these candidates than what we see on front of newspapers, trash magazines, and opponents campaign ads. It would be nice to know that they are made of something real and see some honesty in their words, not propaganda for or propaganda against various \"hot topics\" I will be prayerfully seeking insight as to which of you will be the \"lesser of two evils\" and least likely to: disgrace our country or bring us to social, financial, and political ruin as a world power.', \"Ms. Clinton, I would like to know the truth about your dealings with these emails??

I don't want to vote for either! Dear candidates, right now, neither one of you stand for the same things I do and you do not seem like people I want to run my country. I don't feel like I can trust you. It can be hard to trust any politician these days, but there are definitely others I trust more. I am tired of the lying from you, Hillary. Donald, I can't stand your views on immigration or on women. You seem like a jerk.

However, more than a stance on any one issue, I am looking for a person of integrity.

I am also looking for someone that can work TOGETHER with people with differing viewpoints. If you can show me how you can or will do that, then you have my vote.\", 'Dear Candidate: While all elections are important, this election is even more important than most as it appears the next president will most likely nominate up to three candidates for Supreme Court Justice.  Also, as we see the rise in ISIS and terror both home and abroad, continued levels of underemployment or unemployment, and a porous border and continued illegal immigration, I want a president who is not afraid to make the tough decisions.  I want a president who will address these issues while balancing the budget and begin the slow process of decreasing our national debt.  I want my children to have a country they will be proud to inherit and lead in the future.  These times require not being popular but being strong and moral in leadership.  These are the characteristics that I will watch for in determining who I will vote for in November.', 'I would ask that as you continue your campaign, you keep to the current politics and run a \"clean campaign\". I think mudslinging says a lot more about the person doing the slinging than the opponent. I also feel very strongly that the gap between the richest and poorest person is becoming more substantial. I would like to know how you\\'re going to improve upon that and how you\\'re going to help the working poor.  A plan to help those who tend to fall between the cracks, those who aren\\'t poor enough to get any of the help they desperately need while having those more fortunate pay more would get my vote.', \"Mr. Trump, most of what I've heard of from you is just terrible racist comments about the people in America as well as the Jewish population.  You are also anti-Israel, which being pro- Israel is very important to me.  I don't think we need a dictator for a president. you suck and your fired!!!! Mrs. Clinton, I haven't heard much from you.  Instead of voting for the TV whore, you are what's left. I guess you could say I'm picking the lesser of 2 evils.  Some of the stuff you did in office I didn't really agree with.  I don't recall what they are right now. (due to my MS).\", \"No, faith (at least Christian faith) doesn't necessarily play a strong role (at least when deciding between Christians and secular people). I'm looking for an effective and good leader, not a Christian. Often, the two roles don't align. Jimmy Carter was a Christian, and he was one of the worst presidents we ever had. I would also be very leery of voting for an evangelical in general, because I am sick and tired of the Republican party high jacking evangelicalism and making a mockery of it by their bad governing or stupidity. In terms of Christians though, even though I am evangelical, I would tend to consider a Catholic person more seriously than any other, secular or Christian, with the idea in mind that they might have some classical training in political philosophy (evangelicals usually don't.).\", 'Before it came down to the currently remaining 2 candidates, I would say yes, religion matters or faith if you prefer that word. Now it seems pretty clear to me that neither really has any faith or religion or spiritual life whatsoever. I personally think that they BOTH give the impression that they are lost souls, out for money, power, prestige, etc. I think that a person of faith has a potential to make a better president if they are Christian or Jewish but not other faiths like Islam, because of the teachings that specifically say not Muslims are \"infidels\" and should be killed if they are not willing to follow Islam. Our country was founded upon a desire for religious freedom, but during a time where the current culture was predominantly Judeo-Christian and it was agreed that separation of church and state would insure religious freedom regardless of the religion of the president or governor or any political office (at least on paper). In Islam however, their belief that Islam is the ONLY acceptable religion, it is plausible that an Islamic president could garner enough support from Islamic community, to abolish separation of church and state. We need only look to the Middle East where Islam is the state religion officially making it either illegal to be Christian or financially impossible to be Christian. So, if a Muslim or Muslim sympathetic candidate were running for office, I could not vote for them.', \"I wish faith or religion would play a role in this presidential election. But due to the nature of the two unappealing candidates, I am going to vote for the one who has lied the least and killed the fewest people. I did like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Dr. Ben Carson due to their Christian principles, but of course, none of them are available. I do think that although Trump is not a Christian or even ethical person, I believe he will take better care of the US than the guy in there now who hates my white skin and Christianity, and far better care than the lying woman who continues to skate through lies with immeasurable corruption. Trump at least claims to be a Christian, not sure what the Clinton stance is but whatever it is, I'll bet you a dollar it's a total lie. She reminds me of the chronic liar on SNL played by John Lovitz a few years back.\", \"I do think it's important that a person who leads our country has some faith. Whether it's the faith I choose to believe in is irrelevant to me. I would not necessarily be more likely to vote for one candidate over the other just because they professed to be religious, though. I think a lot of things can be said on the campaign trail and I don't believe those words are always true or followed through with. I believe actions speak louder than words. As in Donald Trump has not been very forthcoming with his business practices and Hillary Clinton has not been honest in her email dealings. I think both of their actions say more about them as people than the words they speak.\", 'I think if the President does have a good basis for faith that it’s fantastic! It would hopefully bring them to a humbling attitude and make them question right from wrong judgment. Unfortunately, though this country is where money talks not faith. I really doubt one person would change that too. That would have to come from generations of small change or an apocalypse. If a president isn\\'t a person of faith which I\\'m pretty sure is Donald Trump, that\\'s the personality you get. The \"hey what has faith done for me, I haven\\'t seen any progress\". You get a cold and blunt personality and a side of no compassion for the weak or sick.', 'Honestly I think it makes a huge difference to the majority of America what religion or even if a candidate is even religious at all. What kind of gets me is that for a nation that risked just about everything to separate ourselves from religious oppression we sure do weigh a lot against you if you are not the \"right\" religion. It’s just sad that everyone thinks that their religion is the \"right\" one and instead of being understanding they shut out others. The majority of Conservative politicians are portrayed as trustworthy or honorable when in reality those are the ones who end up being the most manipulative or greedy.', 'I don\\'t think it makes as big a difference as people tend to make of it. I think being a person of faith can help you be a better leader, make more moral decisions. But none of that matters if you don\\'t have good training in governing or have training the wisdom to know the consequences of your actions. Matters aren\\'t usually black and white. Sometimes you might make a decision that ends up hurting your end, moral goal rather than helping it because you didn\\'t know how to govern. If a leader is not a person of faith, I do believe they are more likely to be corrupt. But the alternative still doesn\\'t work any better if you have a leader making stupid decisions that hurt the \"moral\" goal in the long run. (Female)', 'I think I partially answered this question above, but most of the time I think I feel better if the president is a person of faith. I know they have a moral compass that way, even if it differed from mine. I can feel like they are humble enough to pray and seek counsel from G-d, rather than popular opinion polls or committed and focus groups.', \"It makes a tremendous person if the President is a person of faith because of ethics and truthfulness. It made my heart swell with love and pride when Bush (who I didn't care too much for but at least he was Christian) and Reagan would talk about God in their speeches. Right now it can't even be a favor as we have two dishonest individuals vying for top post in this nation. All I can do is pick the one who lies the least and has caused fewer deaths’ That's Trump.\", \"While I would love to have a person of faith in the White House, I understand that it may not happen. My big criteria is that they do what is right and look out for families and small businesses. I don't want to see them catering to the 1% or to their biggest contribution donors. They need to be able to see what is important in the big picture. We need to work on education, veterans, the poor, job creation, and things like that that make American the best place to live.\", \"It's extremely important for the president to be a moral leader. I'd hope that by the time they reached their spot in office that they won't have a lot of debts owed to under the table politicians. I think being an extremely moral leader goes hand in hand with being a person of faith and if you lack faith you lack a certain amount of morals. For me a moral leader would listen to the people's complaints and even if they were conflicting they would have the patience and answers to defend their views and try to get the opposing on their side. A moral leader would not dismiss views just because they are disagreeing with their own.\", 'I believe greatly in morality. Hence, if they are not a moral leader, then I cannot vote for them at all. Someone who does not have morality is someone who thinks they can do anything even playing god. Someone who is moral will respect values and life and the country they govern over. A moral leader would watch over the country and make decisions based on the citizens needs and beliefs. They would not just make decisions on a whim that would cause more terrorism like Obama. They would focus their attention on the right things and not all of the fluff in the bills they sign and they would read everything to ensure that there is no corruption in the House or Senate.', 'Extremely important!!! There was a time when a presidential candidate would be forced to drop out of the race when he was caught cheating on his wife. Clinton was the first in your face drop of morals. I could not believe he was not impeached for all his under-handed actions while President. For security clearance reasons alone he should have been in trouble. We need to reset our moral compasses with a great leader.', 'It is important for my president to NOT be a moral leader.  Shut up about that, ok?  That is the very last thing I want or need.  Should I require moral guidance or leadership, I will look to my elders or clergy; I will pray and/or read the Bible.  The last place I would look for moral leadership is the president.  Run the country and stay out of religion, please.', \"I want the president to be a moral leader, because he or she is one, regardless of their preference to be one or not. They become an instant celebrity and role model for young people all over the world as well. Bill Clinton disgraced the office of the President in nearly every possible way. Having sex in Oval Office, having adulterous sex in the Oval Office, and elsewhere, then allowing it to be plastered all over the media. He denied so many accusations of sexual affairs or mistresses etc., it was just unbelievable and inconceivable, that he could be innocent of any, much less all of them. Now I think young people who grow up with ambition to be president, no longer value character or morals, because presidents like Bill Clinton (and to be fair maybe even Richard Nixon) didn't seem to need morals religion ethics etc. to be president. I would hope that whoever is elected would stand up, apologize for previous indiscretions and lack of morals and exemplify what a good respectable and ethical presidency would be and be a good moral role model for today's youth, instead of being an embarrassment to America as well as the Western World.\", \"I think it is very important that the president be a moral leader. Whether he or she likes it or not, the eyes of the nation and the rest of the world are watching.  I think some of the things mentioned in the previous question are very important   In addition, I think while people understand that the president is not at liberty to discuss some things that are classified, it's still important to be truthful and not misleading.\", 'tivity 2:  Tone of The Campaign for President', 'w would you describe the tone that the presidential candidates are taking?  How do you feel about the tone they are taking?  How important is a civil debate in the way Presidential candidates speak and address their supporters and opponents?  How would you describe a civil tone in politics to a friend? What would it look like?  Give examples of politicians you view as people who promote or do not promote a civil debate?', \"The tone is very negative. I am completely turned off by both candidates. They are not being transparent. Trump not owing up to his false facts and Clinton not admitting her past mistakes and being very dismissive. A civil tone in politics is very important. It's important for supporters to see an even tempered and controlled personality. It should be one that allows opponents to disagree but in a respectful and truthful manner. Bullying, name calling and using an angry, yelling tone of voice Is not acceptable. Trump does NOT promote a civil tone. Clinton slings mud when she's not being truthful but she is more of a civil toned person. President Obama is calm, cool and collected=civil tone.\", \"I think Donald Trump is extremely hostile. Just hearing him start to speak, his tone of voice makes me nervous. He seems aggravated all the time and I am not sure he is a logical person. He thinks he is always right and doesn’t seem to want to listen to another person’s point of view. That is disturbing to me. You have to be open minded as President. Hilary seems very level headed. She seems logical. I am not sure how tough she would be in illegal immigration. Trump seems tougher with that. I think Hilary would put families first and take a stand with our military. A civil debate is very important to me when they speak to supporters and opponents. They have to have respect for all people. Even if you disagree with someone it is important to hear their point of view so they feel respected. Otherwise people will not want to listen to you. I think it is in a candidate's best interest to act logically. A civil tone in politics is when candidates do not speak over each other, they do not yell at each other and they do not call each other names. It would be a somewhat tough talk, but not too tough and not too friendly either. Mike Huckabee, Hilary Clinton, Ben Carson all promote a civil debate. Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz do not promote a civil debate.\", 'The last debate I watched I thought it was awful/ They need to stop blaming and mudslinging each other. Start getting to the real issues. Healthcare. Debt', \"The tone of all presidential elections ends up being downright nasty.  The candidates are more worried about pointing out flaws in each other and promising more than they are about building their image and honoring their promises.  Our debates have sunk to a level of not answer the questions, not following your time limits, making sure the others don't get full advantage of their times, and going for the biggest shock values.  Presidential debates closer resemble gladiatorial fights than political discourse.  Where candidates should be stating their ideas on big button issues and working to win people over to their way of thinking they are instead trying to avoid the issues and make each other look bad.  I have NEVER seen a civil political debate.  Every candidate is guilty of this modern debating style.\", \"There has been such negativity and bullying in the primary and presidential debates this term that it is very uninspiring and disappointing. I have always been advised to surround yourself with positive people because negativity breeds negativity. I understand that politics is a 'game' unto itself but it gotten so ridiculous how most of the candidates have lowered themselves in the public eye, except for folks like John Kasich, Rand Paul, Martin O'Malley, Mike Huckabee who have stayed away from direct and personal attacks on each other's character.   These candidates all fell to the wayside while Donald Trump rose to the top based on change, fury and controversy.  I certainly wish that the way we could inspire the majority of folks was not by tearing down but by building up. Bernie Sanders for the most part ran a positive campaign of change too. I think that it really is vital to teach our youth, disadvantaged and uneducated that the way to be a proponent of change is to inspire and promote civil discussions where respect when addressing others is the key to true productive conversation.  Candidates can become excited in political discussions but making personal attacks is uncalled for.\", \"The tone that they are taking is one of a condescending one. When it comes to each other, they bash each other and try to defend themselves. They are not focusing on the actual issues enough, but rather he did this and she did that. I do not like that tone. I believe it should be a more focused tone. They should not play like school children fighting, but rather focus their energy on tasks at hand. Because of all the negative comments and advertising and bashing, the true points don't really come out. All it does is get people riled up, when instead there should be productive debates where people are given things to think about regarding their candidates when they are done speaking such as yes I believe that or no that doesn't fit my own beliefs. I believe it is important to have a civil debate, but not one where the candidate simply rags on the other person and riles the crowd up to support them. It should be more of explaining their platform and answering questions truthfully, not like a politician. It is important to have that because some who may not believe in the candidate or vice versa may change their minds about the candidate. I would try to explain it to a friend by explaining that their tone is to try to get you on their side. They can be persuasive and manipulative in how they choose their words to get you to come to their side. The tone is somewhat of a sly fox in the hen house. The fox is able to persuade all the hens to follow him to dinner, which then they become dinner. This means that all of the sly comments and promises can persuade you to vote for them, but then the real truth comes out eventually, so beware. Someone like Donald Trump will promote it because then he can take charge of the situation and ensure that he comes out on top for the outcome of the debate. Someone like Hillary Clinton I would think that would not like a debate with her public email account hanging over her. I would think she would be more afraid of being called out on that.\", 'I think a debate is very important. It gives the voters a chance to hear the politicians view next to each other and be able to hear the cons of each from the opposing politician. I think right now the tone is every poor. I think there is a lot of mudslinging going on from the Trump side.', 'I think the tone of the debates on the Republican side is just awful and about as crazy as it can get. Mr. Trump not only cusses like a sailor that most of the time on TV it is just one big bleep from his foul language. Mr. Trump is always calling his opponents names and acts so uncivil towards people that do not have the same idea as him that he just shows how unpredictable he is. As an example he is just rude to Fox newscaster Megan Kelly it is embarrassing and uncalled for. Ms Clinton runs a cleaner more appropriate debate and campaign. Ms. Clinton is clearer on the issues that are put to her and she treats both her supporters and opponents all with respect. The debates with her and Mr. Trump has Mr. Trump yelling and cussing and Ms. Clinton staying focused and acting civil. It is like night and day in watching the debates with Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton with Mr. Trump not answering questions on the issues and not staying focused and then the name calling and racist remarks start and Ms. Clinton staying on point and more interesting to watch. No young kids should watch the debates with Mr. Trump involved. I think that former Gov. Jeb Bush showed a good example as how a civil debate should be run as well as Bernie Sanders ran a very clean well thought out debate as well.', 'I am embarrassed how this Presidential Campaign “tone\" has become so negative. They’re really haven\\'t been any positive or uplifting aspects in this campaign. Not only do the candidates fight amongst themselves, they also are disingenuous in regards to their supporters. I haven\\'t decided if this is a tactic that there are using to confuse voters, or if they think that name calling is acceptable. Politics has morphed into ugliness. I can\\'t think of a Politician who hasn\\'t engaged in this new tactic of name calling and negativity. A civil tone in politics, in my opinion would be one where a Politician sticks to the facts, such as defining the problem, and how they would resolve the problem. Instead they use confrontation that confuses the issue.', \"The tone I take that the candidates are trying to portray is one of blunt force and one of balancing political correctness/incorrectness. I think Hillary is a puppet for her money financiers. And thankfully even though I'm not a democrat a lot of female democrats I know aren't falling for the female power card. I think it's the strings she has pulled which are keeping her out of prison right now because just like in middle class America that I've experienced it's still really all about who you know in order to be heard or getting a foot in the door. Her tone is misleading and very passive on exactly whatever she's trying to portray. I think Donald is the most bold one because he's not working under anyone else's money but his own so he can throw those million and billionaires out to hang who are supporting his opponents and it looks great for TV. One thing I love about how this political race is turning out is the fact so many hidden money backers are coming to the light. We are seeing for the first time who are pulling the strings of these candidates. That's the one aspect I respect in Donald Trump is that since he owns his money he can do his own talking unlike Hillary who if elected will have a lot of debts to pay in Wall Street investors. I think the fact that so many non-politicians ran this race (even though one remains) it proves America has been slowly waking up to the fact that politicians have been nothing but a face for financial backers who are really the ones pulling the strings in the nation's say of what happens or not. I love reading about Brexit too in regards to waking up in a sense. A civil debate is of great importance! It gives Americans a chance to see how each candidate will respond when posed with the questions were all dying to hear the answer to. It also gives opportunity to see each candidate against each other and judges them on character, poise and especially these debates cunning underhand remarks of he said she said. I am so looking forward to Hillary and Donald's debates. Donald isn't very good at debating at all, however his one handed slap remarks occasionally get the audiences in uproars either positive or negatively and create fantastic TV. These civil debates will be fascinating because Donald does not shy away from name dropping and bringing new light to hidden agendas. I'm curious to see who he brings up from Wall Street in regards to Hillary since New York is his hometown turf too. I would describe civil tone in politics to a friend by explaining candidates are taking a new approach to reach the hearts of Americans by letting us in to more of behind scenes of who's running who. They're including Americans in the conversation and are talking to us in a tone of lowered English so it's easier to understand certain terms they want to get across as well as defining their opponent. They encourage Americans to get involved in what they believe in. An example of a civil tone politician would be Bernie Sanders. His love for the lower classes really shows not only on but off the platform by his decisions to seat coach on an airplane, address every equally and really believes in his messages. Someone who doesn't promote civil debate was Ted Cruz. He is a classic example of a politician who says things he thinks the audience wants to hear and basically answers the question for you. He just really doesn't understand how Americans are evolving in to this simplistic form of speech and response. He tried to continue dying strategies of winning which in the end lost his place in the running.\", \"I do not believe Mr. Trump has taken a civil tone throughout his campaign. He lies and slanders other people’s name. Ms. Clinton has been more civil (though to be fair I have not been following her campaign much). In order to have a useful debate for the citizens to gain knowledge and make decisions about a candidate, the candidates have to be civil. This means, not attacking each other and getting into a screaming match. I think a civil tone requires candidates to speak about the issues that are important without slandering their opponent. When asked questions directly about their opponent, they need to be respectful in their answer. It's ok to say you disagree with someone, but name calling and mockery are extremely uncivil. I recently saw a great clip from Senator John McCain's Presidential campaign. A member in the audience said something about Obama that was not true. The Senator politely corrected the person and gave Obama the respect he deserves a human being.\", 'I think the tone of the debates on the Republican side is just awful and about as crazy as it can get.

Aggressive at times. I feel it diminishes the campaign and takes away from the areas of interest. A debate is important for the voter to appraise what the issues are of importance to the candidate, as well as how professional and informed the candidates are. A civil tone in politics would be the example of the PBS show \"Point Taken\", in which individual topics are explored via various means. Not like a referee match.', \"The tone some of the presidential candidates have taken is juvenile. The name calling and bullying is ridicules.  I'm almost embarrassed by our options. With three candidates in the presidential race there are clearly differing opinions.  They must take a civil tone so we can actually hear what they think about the issues.  As a voter I need to hear the candidates’ views on the issues and what their plans are to address the issues.\", 'Several examples of politicians who promote a civil debate come to mind: John Kasich - He tried very hard to keep the debates civil.  When he disagreed with one of the other candidates he simply said he disagreed and immediately went into his thoughts.  No yelling, interrupting or name calling. Gary Johnson - Gary Johnson is the Libertarian candidate for President.  He does not speak badly about the other candidates.  He sticks to the issues and has explicitly said he will not engage in disrespectful rhetoric.', 'There are two politicians that do not promote a civil debate: Donald Trump - While I agree with his stance on many issues I can\\'t get past how he constantly belittles people with name calling and interrupting.  His arrogance is unbelievable.  I find myself remembering a quote I heard long ago, \"What you do speaks so loudly that I can\\'t hear what you are saying\". Hillary Clinton - She isn\\'t much better than Trump with her arrogance.  How can you have a civil debate with constant interruption and yelling?', 'As I said the Presidential race this year is contentious.  The tone is something that I\\'m embarrassed about.  We know each party has different ideology, but to bring it down to a level where the past is mucked up and spouses are brought into the picture, doesn\\'t bode well on the character of either candidate.  I personally feel as if we are being dumbed down by making the race seem more like a \"look at me\" instead of \"look what I can do\".  A civil tone would be leaving personal feelings at the door, and concentrate on what each candidate wants to do and how they are going to do it, not mock the other\\'s plan.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t think of any politicians that are the voice of reason, but I think Paul Ryan is trying to bring some sanity to the Republicans.  I wouldn\\'t say there are politicians promoting uncivil debate, but I don\\'t think anyone is stepping up to the plate to stop it.  I don\\'t think the moderators of the debates have been very helpful in trying to keep the tone civil', \"I don't think Trump has much respect for other people unless he feels that they have been as successful as he has. Clinton has been accused of being a liar although it seems all political candidates lie. They say woman have to prove themselves much more so than a man, so I wonder if there is any possibility that she can win. Trump has been insulting her and many others. She hadn't been so bad in an outright manner. Those are my thoughts.\", \"I think the tone is getting very personal.  There is so much name calling.  It is so immature.  These are the people that are supposed to run out country.  I think a civil debate is very important.  The voters have to think that the candidate they vote for is able to run the country and make very crucial decisions.  Right now that doesn't seem that this can happen.  Donald Trump certainly does not promote a civil debate.  His ego is so big and his ideas are so off the wall.  It is very scary.\", 'The tine of this election is anything buy civil with trump spreading hate and bigotry and personal attacks he was doing it before this election and it qill just continue to get worse as time goes on. Civil debate in a campaign is very important without it people do not want to vote. Bernie and Hillary have both been civil when it comes to debating even when they do not agree on the other Hand Trump has not been civil with anyone that he has come in contact with putting down other candidates attacking them and their families and throwing temper tantrums because news anchors asked him questions he did not want to answer her is nothing but a spoiled child. A civil tine in politics is when individuals even threw differing view are able to express their opinions and standings while the other listens and responds without attacking or making the debate personal an exchanging of ideas through taking and rebuttal. I believe both Hillary and Bernie promote and engage in civil debate. (Male)', \"I think the candidates are taking a very critical tone of each other. Trump isn't afraid to call names, but Hillary isn't above making unfair, mean comments either. I'd prefer the tone to stay more professional, focused on issues. But I don't want the candidates to refrain from criticizing each other and attacking each other on issues that are important to the campaigns: policy issues and personal issues that are relevant to holding office. It's important how leaders address their supporters and adversaries, I guess, to prove they're a dignified leader, but again, I prefer when people aren't afraid to attack on issues that matter. For example, I hated that Bernie Sanders refused to criticize Clinton on the email scandal. He had an open area of attack. I think a civil tone in politics would be one that was not afraid to have a heavy handed attack where necessary, on issues that matter, but wouldn't make nasty comments about irrelevant matters (person's looks, etc...) or use rude or mean language in general. I think Bernie Sanders is the only one I can come up with who promotes more civil debate. He doesn't descend into name calling, but for too long he didn't attack where it mattered. He could have done so and still remained civil. Donald Trump obviously doesn't promote civil debate (name calling of Ted Cruz, rude to Megyn Kelly), but Hillary also allowed those women in New Hampshire to nastily criticize all younger females for not voting for a woman, as if gender is a relevant issue for choosing a candidate (it's not). (Female)\", \"I feel there are two completely different tones right now in this race. Trump is more or less on the defense (whether he believes this or not is no matter) due to his outspoken nature. A majority of the voters are just about fed up with his misogynistic and racist views. On the other hand, you have Clinton who is on the offensive and using Trump's words against him. However, she deals mostly with the private e-mail fiasco. Although many people, including myself, enjoy the barbs exchanged during debates, they can be quite annoying as well. I much prefer a civil tone because it shows how he or she works under pressure with the spotlight on him or her. If I were to describe it to a friend, a civil debate would include no shouting, yelling, talking over one another, and things of that nature. In recent memory, one that stands out is Barack Obama. Another who stands out to me is John F. Kennedy when debating Nixon. (Male)\", \"I think the tone of this particular election cycle, and with this group of political candidates, will be decidedly hostile, maybe even violent.  I am extremely concerned with the last 6 months of this year.  The candidates are increasingly hostile towards each other, and their supporters are jumping on this bandwagon.  Between protests at speeches and anti-candidate actions taking place, this is going to be a defining cycle in our country's history. Politics are a divisive topic to start with, so it is hard to come up with a specific politician who promotes civil debate.  I would go so far as to say that civil debate has not existed in the United States in over 25 years. (Male)\", 'The tone of the current candidates for the most part seems to be one of superiority. I don\\'t like the current state of tone in presidential politics. It is very important for Presidential candidates to address both their supporters and opponents with kindness and humility. I don\\'t see that at all right now. A civil tone to me would look like someone who isn\\'t seeking to be \"right\" or \"win\" but one who cares for the questioner. A good example would be the way that Jesus responds to his friends and critics. I think Barack Obama is a great example of one who promotes civil debate. On the other hand, I think Hillary Clinton is one who is not civil in tone. (Male)', \"Honestly, the amount of cattiness going on between candidates is childish. I want my leader to be effective in communicating, even when they're criticizing someone. Of course a candidate is going to point out another's weaknesses to show where they themselves are strongest, but you don't have to smear a person to do that. I can't stand Hilary, but she does do a bit better job of promoting a civil debate than Trump. Sanders used to be good at it as well, but he started getting catty in the past couple of months. I'm a bit ambiguous when it comes to Obama, but I think he was a prime example of someone who could successfully promote a civil debate. (Female)\", 'Right now, I think that they are taking a negative tone. This is the point where they are all trying to dig up dirty laundry. I do not enjoy that they are doing that. I think that it is extremely important that the candidates address the supporters as well as the opponents so that we know what they are thinking. I would describe a civil tone as being able to talk calmly while still being able to get your point across. I think that Bernie Sanders was great at having the civil tone. He wanted to help the people and he made sure that it was voiced. He also gave time to hear out his opponent. That is a civil debate, but what is happening now is not. It is just dirty laundry and desperation. (Female)', \"I feel that the Presidential tones are extreme on either end of the spectrum, very liberal Hillary or very conservative Donald Trump. Both sides are equally mouthy and too full of themselves and what they view as the correct path for the nation to take. Their heads are lodged so far up inside themselves that it's a wonder they're still sucking air. A civil tone in politics is level, cool, logical and temperate. Both sides are given equal opportunity to speak, and at the end of it all, we agree to disagree, and move on without blowing the world up. Trump and Clinton are uncivilized. Bernie Sanders uses a proper civil tone. (Male)\", \"I would describe the tone as being combative - on both sides. The tone has been far from civil. In fact, I don't think uncivil is even the right way to describe it; the tone has been vindictive. I feel stressed and anxious about the state of the presidential election based on the combative tone of the candidates. I believe that it is very important for a presidential candidate to speak civilly and with decorum. The average American may not ever meet the president, but they know how he/she behaves and acts based on the way they present themselves. I would describe a civil tone as honest and firm on convictions with no ambiguity. It would look sincere. Politicians that I believe promote civil debate are Speaker Paul Ryan, and honestly that's the only person I can think of right now. (Female)\", \"I feel like both presumed nominees are both embellishing themselves and really degrading the other candidate. I personally felt Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Bernie Sanders all did the best jobs of promoting civil discussions in the Primary Debates. A civil tone in debate is really as simple as avoiding all of the disruptive basic logical fallacies people learn in classical education or in the early years of many colleges. It's really hard to for me to get a clear view of what the candidates want if they don't do this on a regular basis. (Male)\", 'Ok, the tone...Well the tone thus far has been aggressive. But that is nothing new in American politics. Candidates repeatedly sling mud at one another, call each other names, and do everything in their power to make their opponents look terrible. I for one am sick of it. We are all supposed to be adults. It is ok to disagree with one another without trying to crush the other. I realize that I\\'m asking for an unattainable ideal, but a guy can dream. Civility. We go back to what I wish we could have. A true debate and discussion. Not just an argument and name calling. This is not the blame game. I think it should be very important for the candidates to have a truly civil debate, and answer the questions with more than just pointing out how terrible their opponent is. I think Ben Carson was an excellent example of a civil candidate. He was thoughtful, responsive, and talked about what he would do if he were elected. Trump, even though he is likely to be getting my vote, is a terrible example. In fact, he is probably the worst example I can think of. But other candidates are bad too. Even Gary Johnson called Trump a \"pussy\" (pardon me) on camera. REALLY??? You are trying to become the most powerful man in the world and you are going to use language like that on camera? That is just sad. (Male)', 'So far I would say the tone that the presidential candidates are taking has been very negative. I feel that all of the discourse so far has been centered on personal attacks towards the opposing candidate, while both candidates only offer meaningless, repetitive slogans when asked what they would actually do as president. Trump in particular has defied any sort of decency in the way that he insults and demeans women, racial minorities, and veterans. I think that it is crucial to democracy that civility is conducted by the presidential candidates. The American public must be informed of problems that we face and understand opposing approaches in order to choose what they believe is best. The current election has proved not even to be a popularity contest, but a contest for who can be the least hated of the two. A civil tone would look like a rational debate between the candidates, in which relevant and important questions are discussed and realistic and detailed solutions are offered. I think it would be refreshing to have a debate without moderators who bait the candidates into ad hominem attacks upon each other. In terms of examples of political figures, I would say that individuals such as Donald Trump and Chris Christie do not promote civil debate, because their performance in formal debates and their general public persona show little more than political theater. I think that politicians like Ben Carson, Barack Obama, and Ron Paul do promote civil debate because the answers they offer to questions are thoughtful and on topic. (Male)', \"I believe this election will have long lasting and global effects. With everything that has been going on in just the past 6 months or so, it's obvious to me that a liar such as Hillary cannot be in charge. Though, I do question Trumps faith at times when he makes sly remarks, I feel he is at least honest. (Male)\", 'I believe the main tone of the candidates has been combative and insulting against one another. I really feel like it is a waste of time to insult the other candidate. It only comes across as completely biased and immature. A civil tone would be one that only focuses on the policies and issues and only mentions the opposing candidate in an attempt to compare policies and explain why yours are superior. Donald Trump does not debate in a civil manner. He spends much of the time name calling and promoting himself for superficial reasons. (Female)', \"The current state of the presidential election I could describe the tone as being manipulative. I feel like the two candidates, one being Trump in particular, are more worried about being liked so they say whatever they have to, to get people on their sides. This infuriates me to no end. The reason we have elections and candidates is for the issues we have and to speak about them and how they are going to change them! To be the head of this country, I believe one must be very educated. When someone is wanting to be the leader of the country you must act in a dignified manner and be able to hold a civil conversation and debate. I think that is highly important that the candidates speak to each other, the nation, their supporters, and to the press in a dignified and well-manners way. If our future President cannot speak to their fellow American as an equal and without hostility, how can they seek peace with hostile countries and avoid dragging the United States into a war. We have all seen Trumps rally's and his speeches, we have seen his campaign from the start. I, personally, was hoping it was all a joke, but that is one very long example of how not to act. He comes off arrogant and rude. He makes faces and comments against anyone else speaking. Do we want someone so simple-minded as President? He says what he wants to get people on his side, he's a manipulator, and I believe he is just bored with his own failing businesses and decides to run for office. [You speak of an educated candidate and I wish to ask you if you believe the news platforms out there, e.g. social media, newspaper, TV, etc. is giving the public the political information they need to be educated about these candidates and their position on issues? Or are they too concern with the personal?] I do believe that social media is more concerned with the personal and the trivial matters, but watching the debates and watching the rallies, there can’t be anything but simply what the candidate has to say. Now after the debate or rally that is when social media kicks in and starts twisting and turning phrases into what will get them views. (Female)\", 'It is so important. If a candidate responds to protesters in a childish manner, such as what you would hear on a school playground, then that is indicative of how they will act in office. A civil tone would mean that the candidate would address issues people bring up in an understanding manner. Such as, \"I understand where you\\'re coming from and why you feel that way. These are the reasons I believe what I believe, and thank you for bringing insight for me to understand your viewpoint on this issue.\" What is not a civil tone is making blanket statements about certain groups of people, just to get the crowd going at your rallies. (Female)', \"Our candidates our hostile towards each other and each other's followers. I don't like all the anger and hate speech going on at all. Being civil is very important because they can get their ideas across much better if they are not fighting so hatefully. Ronald Regan had civil debates and got his views and beliefs across to us perfectly. We don't need to know how the candidates feel about each other ...we need to know what they believe in and their solutions to our countries problems.\", \"Since I have not really been following this campaign as of yet, this is a difficult one for me to answer. I have not heard either side first hand, and that is by my choice as I don't plan to do my research on candidates until around October I can only say what I have heard others say about the candidates. The only things others have said are about Donald Trump and his poor treatment of women and minorities. Apparently he has said some very discriminating and offensive things. This is the very reason why I chose to ignore everything in the media at this time of the election process.\", \"Hillary is desperate-sounding, a joke, and shrill.  I literally took a survey asking me what behavior could she DO to win my approval.  But I don't like her.  She is a crony.  Rather she has them.  She is a career politician.  And her tone is NEGATIVE.  I see those ads!  The ones she does not approve of.... right...yuh huh. Donald seems to have no edit button.  This leads to a lot of media misquoting him.  But when I read up on the issue and read his exact quotes...I have no real problem with him.  He is very appealing as it is so clear that he is an outsider, and outlier, and has NO cronies in the political realm.\", \"I personally find the tones of the candidates are taking to be unacceptable. I don't like the name calling, I don't like the put downs, And I don't like the bullying. I think a civil tone is very important, because this is the example for the rest of our country! How they speak while campaigning is a reflection of how they will speak to other heads of state. We don't want to be known as a country that doesn't have any manners or respect ability. A civil tone would be using please, thank you, you're welcome. It would be addressing each other with respect, using I statements, instead of blaming statements. I do not feel that Donald Trump uses a civil tone.\", \"Tone should be firm in expressing their beliefs, but respectful when addressing their opponent. It should be mature not mudslinging ads that just incite hate. Trump, It’s fine to say that you think that Hilary should be convicted of __________, but then state your points that you are aware are facts. It's not ok to use national enquirer style headlines with red stars that look like Star of David symbols. The ONLY thing that saved you from being shut dis is that you didn't use a blue star or blue and white because those colors would have clearly been identified with Israel and Jewish people. To a friend I would explain that a civil debate would require each candidate to allow each other to their time to speak and that when they respond, it's ok to be human and show some feeling, but to respond in a controlled way showing some discipline, restraint, and well, basically, CLASS.\", \"I feel their tone is more to deceive us by cutting the other one down. They sometimes are asked questions and answer saying my opedenendt is more concerned about or so fourth they don't just answer the questions asked. In a debate they should answer what they plan on doing for the country not what they want us to believe the other would do. Asking each other how they plan on executing their plan to get to the promise, be civil to one another.\", \"It really doesn't bother me what the tone of the candidates are as long as they do what they say they are going to do. I don't like a politically correct candidate that is lying. I would prefer them to be truthful not matter what the tone is. if he happens to be outspoken that doesn't bother me as long as he gets the job done. I like Donald Trump’s tone that he's not afraid to say what's on his mind where Hillary strikes me as scared of offending anyone. it isn't really important to be the way the candidates speak as long as the job gets done. I would describe a civil tone as being politically correct which I think is ridiculous. Politically correct would look like a black cloud to me. Donald Trump does not promote being civil but I don't care, Hillary promotes dishonesty.\", \"I am not at all happy with the tone to the campaign at this point.  It feels like they are holding themselves up on a very high pedestal, and talking at voters instead of to them.  Instead of telling us how they are going to fix the problems in this country, they spend their time dragging one another through the mud. or covering up for old mistakes they have made.  To me, Donald Trump does not promote civil debate, you are either on his side and cheering for him, or you are verbally abused by him.  I feel like Bernie Sanders is a little more civil, and tries to be someone that the public can relate to. You feel like he's listening to you!\", 'The tone they are taking... Hillary - She is speaking with the voice of enthusiasm. She speaks with the sliver-coated tongue of profound evil and all that is dishonest. She gets people fired up at things that represent goodness and faith. Trump - He is talking the talk with the tongue that is getting the people fired up against many of the things that have gone awry in our nation. Things like intentional overwhelming illegal immigration and taking out isis killers are the things that are on the mind of people like me. He is crude - the opposite of the silver-coated tongue of evil. Yet he is not totally honest and sincere, and far from an ideal Christian ethical example. He is still far better with his crude remarks than she who speaks with a silver tongue of persuasive, tenacious evil. A civil tone in politics is one that comes from the heart with lies and deceit as its building blocks. I prefer an unscripted somewhat harsh response to a smooth talking liar. This is because to me a \"civil\" debate is one which is built upon the truth and sincerity. Thus it\\'s not what\\'s said that matters as much as how honest and sincere what\\'s being said truly is.', \"I feel that both candidates are doing more to tear the other down than to build up their own campaign. It disgusts me that debates have turned so ugly. I want to hear what they will do and have them leave it at that. If debates were civil, I would hear them both speak and give the others a chance to state their ideas as well. A civil debate would mean no name calling or lashing out. They would show respect towards each other. Trump, for example, is one who resorts to acting like a child. He is rude and offensive. When he speaks about his own ideas, it doesn't even come out as making sense.\", 'I would describe the tone that the presidential candidates are taking as bold but crass with Donald Trump and saying what people want to hear but not necessarily truth or what is needed by Hillary Clinton.  We hear a great deal about \"political correctness\" and I feel this has contributed to the moral decay we are experiencing in America.  I am reminded of some Bible verses as I reflect on tone and how that relates to political correctness.  II Timothy 4:3-4 states \"For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.\" Many in America do not want to hear the truth of how our country has been affected by the moral decay of our society and instead prefer to listen to what \"their itching ears want to hear\". While Trumps’ harshness and crassness can be off putting to my perceived standards of manners, I appreciate that he is not afraid to speak truth in regards to how illegal immigration is affecting our country and how politicians have used the system to help themselves at the expense of others in our country. I think civil debate is important but unfortunately because of political correctness as I discussed above, it is difficult to speak truth and still be perceived as participating in civil debate.  It takes a very gifted person to speak truth as related to God\\'s word in the Bible and not be perceived as judging, uncaring, and discriminating against others.  I have been thankful that Trump is speaking with less swearing but I am glad he does not let himself be constrained by these perceived standards of political correctness. Civil tone is speaking truth but in love to others.  I feel Colossians 4:6 says it best: \"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.\" I felt for the most part Ted Cruz demonstrated a civil tone and promoted civil debate during the primaries.  He was never afraid to speak truth and promote positions that were supported by the US Constitution and when given a chance by individuals in the media or during debates was very good at defending his positions but keeping the tone civil.  I also feel Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Rudy Giuliani are the examples of individuals who are able to explain their positions yet maintain a civil tone.', \"I believe a civil debate atmosphere is crucial to upholding the tenants of the democratic process .... of course in try course of the election campaign there will be vigorous debates and spirited conversations. However, what concerns me is what can be viewed as an angry arrogance from Mr. trump and a segment of his supporters in thrnfi of violence and death threats as well as when trump singed out a particular reporter for publishing what he saw as an unflattering profile of his wife. As a result, from what I've read there were vile regencies to the holocaust rituals that we're offensive this was disturbing and trump didn't not inequitably denounce such acts. So his tone and tics concern me and I value the gop platform but am concerned about the personal under the belt insults .in would describe a civil tone as one that shows respect for the opposition and gives the democratic process the respect it demands you can debate and disagree on the issues but when the line is over crossed with insults it's disturbing\", \"I would describe their tone as combative, which is something I really don't want to listen to. I think a civil debate is very important and should be expected. There is no reason to speak in a disrespectful manner or tone of voice to either your supporters or opponents. Even though I didn't agree with all of his political positions, I liked George W. Bush during his debates since he specifically made it clear where he stood on the issues without being making derogatory comments about others. I think he's a good example of how a presidential candidate should behave during a debate.\", 'I think the current campaign is disgusting, both leading candidates have a lot of skeletons in their closet. I would worry that if a candidate cannot treat their opponent (or others in general!) with respect, they would not be diplomatic in situations where diplomacy is required! I live in Wisconsin and realize our governor is a controversial one but he does speak to others with respect and is well spoken. I think that if a person cannot be put on the hot seat in a debate without verbally lashing out, the person does not have the necessary tact to negotiate or smooth things over if such a need should arise.', \"I'm not sure but I would say to the best of my knowledge that they are civil. I think that they should be civil, they shouldn't talk over one another and shouldn't take personal attacks on each other. Being civil when they address their supporters and opponents is a quality I look for in the candidate as well as what they are saying.  If they can't contain themselves in that situation what will they do in crisis.\", 'uld you describe the tone of the Presidential candidates as civil or not? Please give some examples.', 'I would say Donald Trump is not civil. He keeps calling Hillary \"Crooked Hillary\". He is acting like a child in this way. I don\\'t see how that helps us as a nation. He also has a nasty name for all the people in the Republican party. Calling all Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers is awful. It is just plain stupidity. I think Hillary fights back but in a more subdued way. I don\\'t think she is anything but civil. She never calls Trump by any nasty names. She seems to just state the facts. She is classier.', \"I do not call the tone of the candidates civil when Donald Trump makes personal criticisms about body parts, candidate's wives or facial features of women.  This behavior put the other candidates on the defensive and things snowballed so badly that many candidates wound up participating. Now this does not dismiss the fact that some of the candidates who do not present such obvious offenses still manipulate the media and perform underhanded trickery to try to defeat opponents such as when Ted Cruz upstaged Ben Carson out of votes with false rumors of a campaign being suspended. Deceit can also occur quietly too such as with underhanded deals among the leading democrat contender.\", \"I don't think it is very civil right now. I think politicians right now are focusing more on talking about their oppositions faults and not enough about what they are going to do for the country\", 'The beginning of the debates was really bad with Trump all upset with Megan Kelly the fox newscaster and saying really embarrassing things to her and about her and then   Carson not having a clue what was going on and not being very well informed on most issues. Jeb Bush was very well informed in the debates and spoke well and was very civil.', \"I would describe both Hillary and Donald as civil toned candidates. Donald for sure because he provides so much insight on where money is coming from and information on businesses that are leaving the country. He really talks basic English too and I'm not sure if that comes from the fact he isn't very good at debates or that Americans unfortunately only really relate and understand this type of communication. Hillary is also a civil toned candidate even though I don't believe her she really tries to bring one case examples to her debates. Such as here is so and so off this tribal land and we're fighting for their liberties. She tries to bring a lot of sad front cases to light that really don't have much to do about anything and are very one sided cases.\", 'For the most part I have found it to be a civil as possible between the candidates. It started to get ugly a few times in prior debates but definitely a more civil tone has taken place. For example, at one of the last Republican debates both Cruz and Rubio started to throw jabs at Trump and Trump calmly shot their claims down by restating his stance and maintaining a civil tone.', \"This cycle has not been civil, at all.  One only needs to look at the Twitter feeds of each party's individual selections for candidate to see that the rhetoric is inflammatory and as uncivilized as has been in nearly a generation. (Male)\", \"I find the tone for 2016 very uncivil, with people on the one side bitching either for or against the other side.

It's all just one giant mudslinging party. (Male)\", 'I would say it is very uncivil. It seems we have wandered from focusing on what each candidate believes and will accomplish to taking jabs not only at each other, but towards voters. (Female)', \"the tone is angry. people are angry with the government and something needs to change. all the lies about each other are ridiculous, with almost all of them being untrue. they need to stick to the points and what and how they are going to get things done. some of Hillary's commercials are lies. I read her bio years ago when her husband was president and thought that to be the truth, but her commercials don't match up with it.\", \"I don't think the tone is civil.  It feels like there is a lack of respect for one another.  I get that they want to win, but I miss the days when our candidates made the effort to win based on how qualified they are rather than focus solely on winning based on how unqualified the other person is. twenty years ago it would be unheard of for a candidate to openly call someone names, like Trump has in the past.\", \"The candidates that are currently left are out to get each other. They are stabbing each other in the back cutting one another down and not really telling the American public what they're going to do as president. Their tone sounds like anger and backbiting.\", \"I think for the most part it is civil peppered with commentary that sometimes crosses the lines of civility It's perfectly acceptable to point out what you believe your oppositions faults and positions you don't agree with etc. but it is disturbing when there is a subliminal or overt degrading of a group of people it's a cheap shot to stoke some folks fire of intolerance and anti-Semitic rhetoric an example would be the tweet from trump this past Sunday and more so the laze fare response to it\", \"No the candidates are anything but civil. They are both spending too much time attacking each other's characters and decisions. They also seem to be criticizing each other’s followers. So much anger between the two parties as well as within their own parties.\", \"Honestly, I haven't watched any of the debates, but I have read articles about how they went.

I think not only does it make great TV but it's engaging people of all ages to actually start paying attention to the direction this country is going. Bitter and bluntness I see as two separate things. I think Donald is very blunt but makes very valid points and puts Hillary in a light where she has to answer uncomfortable questions not normally in a debate round up and I think it goes the same for her questioning Donald's tactics. I'm very thankful candidates are sort of bullyish this time around because questions are finally being answered and issues being brought to light but I wouldn't call that bitterness.\", \"I think it is true that it has become so bitter.  People only remember all the negative things being said and are not concentrating on anything positive either one of them says. [Who do you think is responsible for the public to only remember the negative things being said? Social media, TV, newspaper, other news platforms, the candidates themselves, other politicians, etc.] I think all of the above.  While watching TV the first thing you hear about a debate is all the negative stuff.  I think we should know what the candidates are saying in their speeches but I don't think it has to be so sensualized. Report first what the candidates are saying they will do for our country.  I have heard people say did you hear what Donald Trump said about women, immigrants, disability.  No one knows what else he said.\", \"I see it that way. American politics is very polarized. I think civil discussion and debate is always possible no matter how different your opinions are. It's the character of the person who determines their behavior in that situation (ex: Bernie Sanders has good character whereas Hillary and Donald don't). We don't have good politicians of good character on either side of the aisle for the most part. That's the real reason we can't have civil discussion. (Female)\", \"I am not sure that I agree with that statement. I believe it just takes two special candidates emerging and running against one another. For example, Kasich and Rubio were mostly civil in the Republican debates and stayed on topic as opposed to veering in another direction.

They are open to learning new ideas and listening to them they just aren't willing to do the work themselves, which is kind of sad and isolating.

As far as faith guiding my decision not sure if I\\'d call it that as much as I would my gut or instinct. At this point in time I have not decided who to vote for because frankly I\\'m not comfortable with the shenanigans of all of them.

Could you elaborate on your comment about gut and instinct as your guide for which candidate to support? I am curious, thank you.] This is my sisters view as the election continues I continue to become more annoyed and flip flop between my choice in candidates... I believe it is more of my gut instinct that will guide my final decisions...in other words what at the moment in time seems the best decision... I don\\'t know some may call that relying on their \"faith\" I guess... Or \"beliefs\" ... It will be an informed decision but one I just can\\'t make at this point in time.', \"I talked with my cousin on Tuesday. She says it is very difficult to keep up with all the news that happens. She said it seems there is something new every day. She says she is not happy with either candidate. She is very religious and says she does not see either candidate as a person of faith. She wants the President to have a good relationship with God to help that person make decisions. She and I are of similar faith backgrounds. [I understand if you cannot answer this, but why does your cousin not believe either candidate is a person of faith? What is her definition of faith? Why does she believe the President should have a good relationship with God and what would that look like? Of course, if you have answers of your own to these questions, I welcome them. Thank you.]  I would say my Cousin's definition of a person of faith is someone who references the Bible at times. Also, she believes he or she should be at church at minimum once per week. She believes a President should have a good relationship with God because it says a lot about their character. That they really take seriously the values of God. They care about others more than someone who does not have a relationship with God. I know she and I think the Presidential candidates need to be talking about God in their speeches. We discussed this one day that neither one mentions God or his or her faith very often. I believe faith is when you do the best you can, do what is right for others and believe and pray that everything will be ok. I believe the President should have a good relationship with God because if they don't believe in something they will fall for anything.\", 'I had a conversation with 2 ladies from my church when we were doing our weekly volunteer work at the food bank. All 3 of us agreed that the tone for this presidential election was acidic and pathetic, and did not represent the views of all of America. While faith is important for a candidate to have, we all agreed that it would not be the one final decision factor to support a candidate. There are too many important issues in this country, that need decisions made, and a candidate needs to have more than just a faith quality. The reason being that a President has to have the capacity to make very tough judgement calls, and while he may be able to rely on his faith to make those decisions, he needs to also have leadership and compassion to make really tough decisions that may be out of his faith comfort zone.', \"I had a discussion with my neighbor who is also a stay at home mother. She is along the same lines as myself that whoever wins this election isn't going to be the best fit in regards to fixing the country because they both portray some scary elements at times. She told me that she plans on voting for the third party candidate like her husband. I tried to explain to her that that candidate doesn't stand a chance against the electoral college and voting for him would be essentially voting for Hillary, who we both agree is the worst of both candidates. I don't think I was able to persuade her vote though. Since we belong to the same faith it really didn't play a role in our conversation since we agree on the mainstream issues such as abortion, the Mexican Wall and the transgender issue. [I understand both your positions on the candidates, but if the candidates were to have the same views on the issues you stated, but did not necessarily share the same faith or religion as you, how would that play into who you support?] Oh, sorry! As long as the candidate has the same views as I mentioned neither myself or my neighbor would have an issue with their faith/religion. I feel my issues correlate with faith so I'd be assuming that the candidate would belong to the same faith if not at least believe in the same God. But if they did believe in a different God and support my causes besides being strange I wouldn't judge them for practicing freely because it would just be a contradiction of my own belief.\", \"My conversation was with my husband whose faith and political views are similar to mine.  He didn't seem to be quite as offended by the tone of the election as I have been.  The fact that the two major parties are almost polar opposites on their views breeds contempt.  My husband feels like the civil disrespect we have seen is normal at this point in an election.  One point he did make was that the bullying and name calling wasn't necessary.  He and I totally agree on this point. Faith did not play a factor in our discussion, per se.  We did discuss whether excluding/targeting select groups would be the Christian thing to do and agreed that it would not be.  However, both agreed that there has to be a vetting process to protect our country from those who would do us harm.  Making a blanket statement to exclude a specific ethnic group from entering our country is stereotyping and a few bad apples don't ruin the whole basket. [Why do you believe your husband has not been as offended by the tone of the election compared to you? I understand you and your husband's position on immigration and if a candidate made drastic measures on immigration, such as Trump, and it made the country safer would you still consider that candidate Christian or not?] My husband feels like our country needs to address some key issues and that calm discussions haven't produced results.  He feels like we need to get mad at this point in order for change to happen and Trump is definitely mad.    Personally, I try not to mix religion and politics.  There are men/women who don't consider themselves Christian but they are good people and strive for a safe, prosperous country.  I have many non-Christian friends who I love and trust.  Some have differing political views but some have the same.  The key is that we can discuss our commonalities as well as our differences in a civil manner and still remain friends.    As far as considering one a Christian if they result to drastic measures to stop or slow immigration, I am reminded of the old WWJD acronym.  What would Jesus do?  Would he turn away those in greatest need?  I don't think so.  However, one must be able to discern truth from those who would manipulate.  I am a Christian but I am not voting for a candidate because of their religion or their faith.  I am voting for the candidate who will get our country back on track and grow our economy.  I'm voting for the candidate who will lay the groundwork for my grandchildren.  I don't believe Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton will be the one to accomplish these tasks.\", \"I had this conversation with my mother, who is Catholic. She sees the tone of the election negative and unruly. The discussion did involve the idea of faith. We discussed how both candidates are really not the best for the job overall, and for her, her faith and what her values are and beliefs are, are causing her to not want to even vote in the election. She doesn't feel like her vote would make a difference because they are both bad candidates in the first place. She feels that Hillary is way too far one way and Trump is way to uncensored. The discussion focused on more why she didn't like the candidates and how it has gotten so worse over the years with all the crap they pull. She said she just wishes that there would be elections without all the crap and mudslinging between candidates and false promises or loud mouths. It then led to a discussion between the both of us discussing how even local politics is corrupt and that all the corruption in the world and the US in general from local to presidency is all corrupt and people get bought out. She then commented on Hillary's emails and that the FBI decided not to prosecute. She thought that was ridiculous because of morality, which I agreed. [I understand your mother's position, and I am curious as to why she believes it is ridiculous that Clinton was not prosecuted by the FBI based on morality? If a candidate had high morals, but not necessarily the same faith/beliefs/religion as your mother, do you believe she would be willing to vote? What would inspire your mother to participate in voting in the election?] She thinks that anyone else would have been prosecuted but she was a First Lady and is now candidate so they are protecting her perhaps. If they had high morals yes. Even if they disagreed on some things. High morals are important. She said a candidate with high morals because she doesn't see any right now.\", 'I spoke with my husband and he and I see eye to eye with this whole campaign/election. He believes Mr. Trump has been very uncivil throughout, lots of name calling, lies and being downright mean. He also said that he found Mrs. Clinton\\'s campaign to be very arrogant, anyone who disagrees with her on an issue must be an idiot. My husband also does not plan to vote for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. Our faith didn\\'t play a huge roll in this particular conversation. Though I know our faith has led us to believe we cannot support either candidate from a moral standpoint. Just today my husband quoted C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity) in reference to being unable to support either candidate. \"I feel a strong desire to tell you--and I expect you feel a strong desire to tell me--which of these two errors is the worse. That is the devil getting at us. He always sends errors into the world in pairs--pairs of opposites. And he always encourages us to spend a lot of time thinking about which is the worse. You see why, of course? He relies on your extra dislike of the one error to draw you gradually into the opposite one. But do not let us be fooled. We have to keep our eyes on the goal and go straight through between both errors. We have no other concern than that with either of them.\"', \"I had a conversation with my boyfriend.  The election frightens them.  They feel that this is another case of choosing the better of two evils.  They feel that neither of the candidates is honest or has the interests of America at heart.  Both candidates seem snide and looking to get the biggest reactions out of their statements rather than actually contribute possible solutions or political ideas.  I asked him about how his faith came into consideration and he mentioned that if he had to pick one he would vote for Hillary because Trump's extremism and seeming belief that he should control everyone's choices for the good of white people who believe they should control everything is terrifying.  But he did mention that Hillary's actions and words do not exactly show her as a compassionate candidate who understands what is it to be an average American citizen either.\", 'I spoke to my neighbor who is very religious.  She said she was very concerned about the election.  She feels Donald Trump is not a Christian and said she would only vote for a Christian.  Her family is very hard core.  I told her that I felt that the country has more important things to worry about than if a candidate is a Christian.  I said there are good and bad in all religions and good and bad in people who do not have any religious beliefs.  She started quoting the bible so I was done.  You cannot have a debate with some people who have such strong beliefs.', 'I had a conversation with a man I know. He is very intelligent and has been following the election closely. He said he was very disappointed in the tone of the campaign because there is so much insulting going on back and forth between the candidates rather than more concern about the country and the issues being the main focus. His response to religion playing a role was \"we are one nation under God.\" I don\\'t believe he is very religious and I am not myself.', 'Conversation with my sister in law. She views the tone of election as part of the way of society is becoming more ugly///more hateful with disagreement. Less kindness. Her faith reflects her choice; democratic party appears more obligated to fellow man. (Hillary is not her first choice, but essentially her only choice now).', \"I had a conversation with my husband.  He saw the tone of the campaign as being combative, cantankerous and petty. We both believe that faith had nothing to do with the views that both of us hold. We both think that the candidates should be discussing policy in civil manner and that the issue of religion has taken a back seat. Issues like abortion, gay rights and the family seem to put on the back burner.  What is on the forefront is immigration, terrorism and jobs. These are major issues that I want addressed but at the same time I also want equal rights for the lgbtq communities and the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body. Perhaps we feel that the conversations among the candidates have not been appropriate at times because we both possess a value system that frowns upon the lack of decorum between the leading contenders. [What would you and your husband need to hear or relate to from the candidates to feel they possess the value system you believe they are lacking? I understand you believe specific issues of religion have taken a back seat, why is that? How do you see a way to bring this issues forward and have conversations about them in a way that possess the value system you mentioned?] First of all, I would like the most recent announcements involving Hillary Clinton 's issues with her email fraud to be addressed directly by her.  She has not responded to the justice' dept's findings. As of yesterday the state dept is reopening the case. I distrust her even though I find her to be the more professionally presenting & diplomatic candidate. I need to hear her relate to the American public on the issue of honesty, scruples and disclosure.  Even if she apologized and admitted a mistake and moved on from there that would more reassuring to me. She may have addressed this in such a long drawn out saga of dealing with this issue but I feel she needs to settle the issue perhaps in a 1-1 interview with a news person or religious leader. I just find that there is an aura of deception and 'back door deals' that surround both her husband and her.  Frankly, there are aspects of Bill Clinton that I admire. He is a charismatic individual that did a lot of good for our country despite his private downfalls.  As for Trump, I think that he needs to speak more about his faith as a man and how this will help him lead our country into change. I think that he needs to explain his value system if he has one and how he will make our nation greater through policies that he will make. I believe that he needs to speak more about he has raised his family, built a business and cares about people in a more practical, gentler tone that makes sense to those who are unsure of voting for him. I think we need to see another side of him to reassure us that he can handle criticism, major decisions and diplomacy.  Religious related issues are secondary to me at this point.  Economic/job related issues, national security/terrorism handling, immigration reform along with proper handling of human rites and health care are paramount to me. Secondary are issues that relate to pro-choice/pro-life decisions, lgtbq rites, stem cell research, etc.  These certainly are human issues that need to be discussed and clarified so I would like to hear his stand on these things perhaps in a 1-1 interview too. Politicians flip flop on so many things and I understand that people can change their views as they learn more about a topic. I think I would like a civil discussion that is held in a professional manner allowing each to voice their opinions without tearing each other apart and that is why I think such interviews should be done separately.\", 'I talked to my neighbor and we had a very good long talk about the election and how she has chosen not to vote in the upcoming election. My friend Alice thinks that neither candidate has a \"good moral compass\" and that she thinks both are as far from being religious as one can get. I have to admit neither one of us knew what religion either candidate belongs to. We both agreed that Trump is to much of a wild card and we do not like to watch or listen to what he has to say because of his foul mouth or as she says \"potty mouth\" and we both agreed that Hilary is running a cleaner campaign. We both like the stance that Trump has on abortion but were not sure what else he stands for. It was an interesting conversation but we both are glad that religion has not muddied the water of this already strange election. [I understand you both believe that religion has not muddied the water in this election, and I wish to ask why you both believe this? Using your term, what issues have muddied the water among candidates?] Both candidates do not speak about religion much or at all from what both my neighbor and I have seen or heard but I have not been keeping up much on the campaign the last couple of weeks. Both my neighbor and I feel that both candidates do their fair share of name calling and bring up negative issues like Clinton and her emails and not being charged and Trump and his investment school or Trump not showing his tax returns or Clinton and Benghazi. Doesn\\'t seem like either candidate talks about the family unit, moral values and how they would stop the killing of each other.', 'I had a conversation with my Mother. She feels the tone of the election is pretty fair. She thinks Trumps ideals are pretty racist and harsh but feels most of America wants drastic change. My Mom and I believe in having equality and that everyone deserves a chance to live with the right to do what is morally best. She feels our nation has started to lose sight of what is best for us as a nation and that we need to start looking at a bigger picture.', 'I had a conversation with an associate pastor at my church, how I had known for many years.  I knew that we had similar viewpoints, and despite that, he had a well-known history of being open-minded. That being said, in his politically active life (some 15 years more than me), this is the first election cycle in a long time that he was actually worried about.  With fiery rhetoric and mass public protests and rioting, he said that this time in our country\\'s history will be one of the most volatile on record. Being members of the same church, we discussed the matter in a faith-based context.  We were both in agreement that a sort of divine intervention will need to take place to keep the country from falling into chaos.  I tend to take a more direct approach to daily living, where he more strongly believes that God plays an ongoing and active daily role in the lives of humanity.  While I tend to believe that the United States will be allowed to fall into an unrecognizable state, he tends to think that something will happen that will cause a resurgence of religious activity in the country, \"righting the ship,\" so to speak.  I hope he is right. [If you can, could you elaborate on what you both mean of a \"divine intervention?\" What would that look like? I understand you both have opposing looks on the country, but what makes you believe the country will fall into an \"unrecognizable state?\"] Sure!  What I understood was that the \"divine intervention\" that he spoke about would be an event that could have no other explanation other than the hand of God.  I am scared to think of how this may manifest, but I am hoping that this will be for the good of our country.    I think that, up to this point, how he and I view the history of the United States would have been fairly congruent, albeit that his life experience may have shaped his opinion more than my academic view of the relative past.  My biggest concern is that neither of the candidates that are up for election this cycle have the favor of any big part of the populace, and so despite who wins, and by how much, there is going to be an uprising that will create massive civil unrest.  This could fundamentally change the social structure in the US.  I think this, and the avoidance of it, is where the pastor is going to be looking for the \"divine intervention\" that he was speaking about. (Male)', 'I had a conversation last night with my boyfriend, Jamie. Him and I share a similar view on the presidential election. We view it as manipulative and a joke. Neither of us are fans of Trump or Hillary, but if given the choice we both agreed Hillary would be a better choice out of the two. Faith played a minor role in our discussion, mostly because we both believe the president should be about the countries needs not for the needs of a certain faith. We also agreed that along with our faith it is said to treat people with respect and decency, to love your fellow man, and to not cast stones. (Female)', 'I had this conversation with my mother, and she saw the tone of the presidential election as a mud-slinging contest \"as it always is\". My mother is religious as well, so we were able to talk about faith in the election. She said she would very much prefer a candidate who possesses Christian morals and has a track record of doing so (as opposed to just saying they attend church, for example). [What kind of track record would your mother need to see or hear to feel that an individual possesses Christian morals? What if the candidate was not of Christian faith?] She would need to see that he or she has voted with Christian values (if any political experience), such as pro-life, etc. If the candidate was not of a Christian faith, my mother would have a difficult time voting for him or her. (Male)', 'I actually talked with my boyfriend. It was interesting, because it was something that we had never talked about before. He thinks that the tone of the election is interesting, but not in the least bit civil. Our faith did not play a role, but only because we were looking at the big Picture. Both candidates are doing inexcusable things, but at least Trump is out in the open about it. We talked about the fact that religious groups are being attacked, and we both took the stance that something needs to be done about it. No matter who wins. (Female)', \"I had a conversation with a male friend of mine that I attended seminary with. He is conservative, but not partisan by any means. I think he's an Independent. I don't think he's registered with any party. Anyway, he sees the tone of the presidential election as rude and cutthroat, probably more so than ever. He thinks that both Trump and Clinton are uncivil. He was especially horrified by Trump's attitude towards Muslims. He clearly identified Trump as the more uncivil candidate (I agreed). I think faith played a role largely in the sense that our faith is what guides our moral outlook on life and on situations such as this. We talked about that being about it in terms of how faith affects our political decisions though. (Female)\", \"I had a conversation with my 93-year-old grandmother regarding the presidential election. She is a devout Christian, although at times her beliefs descent from what other Christians may view as the correct answer. My grandmother views the tone of the election as somewhat of a circus; she notes that either side is guilty of mudslinging, and that both sides play dirty and take cheap shots at one another. Faith plays a part in her decisions, insofar as she believes that we are all God's children; we shouldn't necessarily be judged in terms of our religion or race, but at the same time, she understands the desire for wanting to keep the nation safe from extremist individuals. (Male)\", 'I had a conversation with a good friend of mine, Wendy. She is in her 50\\'s and is of course a person of faith. She seemed to feel that the tone of the election is about the same as any other election in the past. She said that all the personal attacks and controversial topics present is what one should expect any election year. To me she seemed to think nothing wrong with the tone of the election but, to be fair, she does not follow the campaigns very closely nor does she watch tv. All she is basing her stance on is articles read online and conversations with her friends and family. I personally did not think that my faith or her played too big of a role in the whole conversation but, I did directly ask her if her faith had any say in how she felt about this election. She stated only that her faith in God has shown her that voting for Donald Trump is \"the right thing to do\". I am really not sure why she is basing it on not too many facts and just feeling but, that\\'s what she said. (Male)', 'I spoke with my mother about this topic. She sees the tone of the campaigns having a sense of urgency or desperation. When asked about the civility of the campaigns, she responded in saying that \"no, it has not been civil. But then again, in all my years I\\'ve never seen a civil campaign. They are always hostile\". Haha almost every conversation I ever have with my mother is affected by our faith. As important as faith is to me in politics it is even more important to her. She is convinced that Hilary is a terrible person, and believes that anyone is better than her. Although she doesn\\'t love Trump in every way, she believes that he is at least a man of faith, and thus will be voting for him. (Male)', \"I had my conversation with my father, who is an Evangelical Christian. He stated that he thought the tone of the election was negative overall. My father supports Trump over Clinton, but he expressed a definite distaste for Trump's loudmouthed antics. When asked about the level of influence that his faith has over his decision-making process, he stated that the only area that he feels that his faith influences him is the issue of abortion. He did say, however, that he feels that stopping abortion from occurring is a losing battle, and therefore it doesn't carry much weight in his choosing a candidate. He said that what's most important to him in choosing a candidate is whether the individual will likely uphold the Constitution, and that his faith does not influence this notion very much. (Male)\", 'I had the conversation with my mom. She shared that the tone of the presidential election was like the candidates were always one-upping each other, like the tone was implying that it’s a popularity contest. She furthermore conceded that when she was a young adult the campaigns had their fair share of mudslinging. But this presidential election has had an unprecedented social media eruption of chaos and negativity. Faith had an afterthought appeal, kind of \"Oh and by the way, I wish my faith and morals were being represented. The president needs to be a strong moral leader and that just isn\\'t happening.\" [I understand your mother\\'s reflection of past and present elections and appreciate her insights. I am curious as what you mother believes represents a strong moral leader?] I understand my mother\\'s beliefs according to Christian biblical teachings that a person of strong character will be above reproach, that a strong moral leader will be careful and intentional in their behavior so that their lifestyle reflects their convictions, and that if they falter they are humble enough to admit their mistakes and seek wise counsel. (Female)', 'I spoke with Megan Moore, my coworker. She has a similar viewpoint to mine to politics in general. We have different faith but she also sees how many politicians are not very civil, especially Donald Trump. She expressed her feelings against him and how she dislikes his way of living life. She said faith is irrelevant for politicians because it is just a front that they put on. She doesn\\'t believe that they can have true faith. I was incredibly surprised to hear her response and how similar it was to mine. I felt encouraged as my opinions are often unique. [I understand Megan\\'s position, and I am curious to understand what you mean by having true faith? If you both believe that a candidate cannot have true faith, what guides your decision about who to support? How does the candidate\\'s religion affect your decision?] I can\\'t remember her exact words but I remember she said politics and faith can\\'t go together or be used to influence each other. Basically her faith is completely separate from politics and she does not use it as a judgement criterion. I agree because they cannot have \"true faith\": James 2:14-19 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. Faith of the candidate does not affect our decisions because these candidates seem to me like the demons here, only believing in one God but not having any deeds. This verse was selected by me but I would imagine Megan agreeing. The only way that faith would affect our decision is if the candidate actually had faith, which I have never seen or can imagine seeing in the future. The one that came closest was probably Ronald Reagan but at the same time his faith was in a church not God. The church he attended (Catholic church) has numerous church leaders that molest little children as if it is nothing.  Our decisions are guided by logic and understanding of the governmental system as a whole. We choose a candidate based upon how much they might benefit our families with their political decisions. It may be important to mention that we both work at a law firm. We are both dissatisfied with the current candidates, as well as those who took part in the primaries. (Male)', 'I had a conversation with my younger brother who will be a freshman in high school this coming year. He said in his friend group and the little he sees on the news he thinks there is a generally negative tone from both parties in all assets of the election. In his eyes he felt like most of it almost seemed like a joke. He is obviously a little younger than myself, but from a faith standpoint he basically said, \"I don\\'t think either of them have much real faith, so I would probably pick the lesser of two evils and vote for Trump if I were old enough.\" Obviously we come from the same household, but I was still intrigued at how similar our thoughts were on the issue. (Male)', \"I had the conversation with my friend Chris who is a person of strong faith. He believed the tone of the campaign to be hostile. He felt Donald Trump's tone was very combative and Clinton's tone comes across to him as corrupt and dishonest. He expressed to me that while he is a person of faith, he does not feel the president absolutely has to be. He indicated that as long as they are honest and true to their beliefs, he would trust them. [I understand Chris' position that the president does not have to be a person of faith. Does this also apply to the religion the president practices?] I think it doesn't. I think the president can have a religious practice and keep it separate from the presidency.  (Female)\", \"I chose to talk to my best friend Jessica. She is a Lutheran just like me and attends church about once a month, but grew up going almost every weekend. However, she is incredibly liberal in her beliefs which isn't always the case with Christians. Her husband owns a gun shop so that leads her to be a bit conservative in certain areas. She basically thinks that Trump is a complete jerk and that Clinton would make a much better president. She agreed, though, that she would rather have neither of them become president. Faith played much less of a role in her opinions than I thought it would. She really doesn't even take that into consideration when voting. As stated above, she's almost completely liberal. [I understand Jessica's position; did she go into further detail as to why would not want Clinton as president even though she believes Clinton to be the better choice? What made you think that Jessica would let faith play a larger role in her opinions? Why do you believe there is a correlation between being liberal and how much someone lets faith factor into their opinion?] She didn't go into much detail about Clinton. I'm used to hearing from pretty much everyone I know that neither of the candidates are ideal so I didn't really ask why not considering I'm just so adapted to hearing that now. Strong liberals like Jess tend to take pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage to an extreme. While I support both of those to a certain extent it definitely does conflict with what we are taught in the Bible. That's the biggest reason I usually associate faith with being more conservative. (Female)\", \"I talked to my mother and she has similar doubts about our candidates. She believes Trump would be far better then Clinton because of some prophecies she has heard. I do believe God can use anyone. She gets so mad listening to Hillary lie her way out of trouble. She sees the tone as very hostile. Faith has to guide our decisions as Christians it's our duty to try to support people who can make the world better. [I understand your mother's position, but could you elaborate on the prophecies she has heard?] My mother reads things from the Elijah list online. This is a link from a prophecy that they had on their site for a while. https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=2016+presidential+prophecies&&view=detail&mid=B91B0FCF1D430A3EA945B91B0FCF1D430A3EA945&rvsmid=CA1884FA25CA5D0EDC32CA1884FA25CA5D0EDC32&fsscr=-3960&FORM=VDFSRV\", \"My husband Rob. He sees the tone just about normal (a lot of name calling and stupid comments mostly from Trump or Trump supporters) for today's climate. Well Rob and his family are Catholic and were always democrats and traditionally voted democrat. He is registered democrat but tells me he votes his conscience. He does not tell me who he actually votes for but I am guessing we cancel out each other's vote from time to time. My family is all Protestant but my parents were registered democrats just so they could vote in local elections and primaries where there were mostly democrats while they tended to hold conservative Christian views. I am registered republican and usually vote republican but I have voted democrat from time to time, just not recently. The primary topic of our conversation is how can we as faithful Christians vote for Hillary or Trump? Rob is pro-life but said that he was taught in seminary not to make a choice for a candidate on just one issue. I said I understand that in concept, but I can't feel good about putting Hillary in office because of her support of abortion for anyone who wants one. Robs view is that I am too narrow in this thinking. His family is also military (marine) so I think he is mindful of Hillary’s experience abroad as sec state. I see her as dishonest and deceitful and basically a person who misrepresents on a major scale and when caught, still got out of situation so I can only imagine bribery or blackmail was involved. My faith and Robs faith are strong and sincere, but it seems we have to discern our choice to vote differently. We can't really judge either candidate as a Christian because neither really is one. So all we can do is judge them by what they are whether it be lawyer, businessman, diplomat or real estate developer or former First Lady. Do you judge a quarterback by his faith or his touchdowns? Touchdowns of course! We basically agree to disagree.\", 'Good morning!!!! I had a conversation with my friend who lives a couple house\\'s away. It started good. She is a straight trump supported. She likes the fact he is going to a \"\"wall\\'\\' which we had a debate on how this would be done or even be affective. Then we talked about abortion. Where she thinks it’s not up to women it is murder. Now I had in the past felt if you couldn\\'t afford or were in a bad way, drugs, abusive relationships, homeless, or just couldn\\'t afford a child it was okay. Now after having 6 kids and as of yesterday at 7 pm 9 grandchild I feel if the child was conceived as a result of rape or the mother or child we in physical danger and it’s before 14 weeks its Owe were both at a disagreement. On her being of Jewish decent and I myself being catholic she was saying your catholic you don\\'t believe in abortion. As many Catholics are pro-life it’s not a deal breaker being a catholic. [It seems that the topic of abortion is important to you and your friend. May I clarify that if the candidate was Catholic that would not be an issue or is their position on abortion more important? What if the candidate was another faith or religion?] Their beliefs in religion have no bearing on my vote.       It’s about their stance on things. Immigration is a very big thing as is national security.       We were speaking more on abortion because of the fact I have 6 Children, and now 9 grandchildren. She was saying typical catholic upbringing that\\'s how we got our the subject. Lol...Thank you so much on my grandson...', \"I talked to my best friend. She and I took our children and voted together in the election 8 years ago, when my youngest was 3 months old! She does not see this election as good, considering the 2 who are options. She prays God will take mercy on us. Our choices are about as far from godly as possible, so all we can do is have faith. She pointed out how far we have fallen away from God since Bill Clinton was in office. Yes, sin has always been rampant in politics, but it was always kept hidden. To have our president have an affair and then lie about it was awful, but we as a country turned the other way. She says that was when we as a country started to really justify our sin. We both think it is a shame that there are good people who would be wonderful leaders, but they won't get the chance because of that fact. This country does not seem to want godly and wise leadership.\", 'My husband. He sees the tone of this election as very bad. His faith plays an active role in who he votes for, but for the past several elections it has been more a voting for \"the lessor of 2 evils\". I agree with him, I don\\'t really want to vote for any of the candidates since none stand for what I believe, so I also choose the lessor of 2 evils.', \"Most of my friends are Jehovah's Witnesses. At least the ones of faith are. As you may or may not know, Jehovah's Witnesses do not take part in any political activity. They like to see themselves as no part of this world. I did try to speak with a friend but she professed to be unconcerned and not interested in the current political goings on. Now, I believe that in fact she does pay some attention to what is going on but she won't admit that because to do so would be to admit that she is not being obedient to the leaders of her faith. So there was not too much of a conversation as I'm sure you can imagine.\", \"I talked to my husband about the election, we both agreed that the tone of the election wasn't what we would call civil, and it felt like the candidates were working harder to tear one another down than to lift themselves up. He said he doesn't really focus on the campaign itself from a faith based perspective, if he knew outright that a candidate did not believe in God or followed a religion that was vastly different from his own (examples mentioned were, Jehovah Witness, Mormon, Muslim) he would be far less inclined to vote for that person. [Why does your husband feel less inclined to vote for a person who believed or followed a religion vastly different from his? How vast would it have to be?] The three religions he mentioned were Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormon, and Muslim.  He said that he felt they might have different priorities and a different moral compass than he would want in a leader.\", \"I had a discussion with my husband about this. I had wanted to discuss it with someone else, but I've had to work a lot of overtime at work. He expressed that he thought the tone of the presidential candidates was unprofessional, and agreed with my assessment when I said I thought the tone was combative. In discussing what we thought of the tone of the candidates, our faith did not come up.\", 'I had a conversation with a close friend from church and from my life group at church.  We had discussed politics earlier in the year during the primaries, but had not discussed the presidential election in several months. She is not pleased with the candidates that are left after the primaries and sees the tone of the election as this point as not civil and rather unprofessional.  She deems the office of President as a position that is worthy of respect and honor and feels the current candidates lack these qualities and do not give the position respect.  We did discuss faith and how it shapes our views regarding our role in society in regards to voting and what God\\'s word says about it.  We also discussed other well-known Christians who have shared their views on the election and whether we agreed with them or how we disagreed.  We discussed how the election of either main candidate could affect our lives and would affect the country in the coming years.  Our faith is who we are so of course it played a role as we evaluated both candidates and how we felt these candidates would govern in regards to our faith. [Could you elaborate on how your faith will play a role in evaluating the candidates and what would it take for you to support a candidate? What were the views of the other well-known Christians you spoke of?] Our faith played a role in evaluating the candidates by using Scripture to discuss immature Christians vs. mature Christians vs. cultural \"Christians\". Cultural Christians is a term she uses to describe someone who professes they are a Christian but it seems unsure whether they have a true saving faith in Jesus. This is seen a lot here in the South/Bible belt where almost everyone says they are a Christian but not all demonstrate characteristics described by the Bible of a Christian. We discussed how it can be convenient for politicians/candidates to identify with Christianity but do their actions, words, votes on legislation align with God\\'s Word. She and I describe immature Christians as those who are new to a relationship with Jesus Christ or have not matured in their faith since receiving Christ as their Lord and Savior. Mature Christians are those who do demonstrate growth and sanctification and also demonstrate fruit from their relationship with Jesus as described in Matthew 7:10 \"Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\" and Colossians 1: 10 \"so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,\". This is how our faith is being used to evaluate the candidates as guided by our faith in the work of Jesus and the Word of God.   The views of other well-known Christians have discussed the possibility that Trump may be an immature Christian. Some well-known Christians spoke out strongly against him in the primaries but have been quiet since he is now the Republican nominee. Other Christians have supported him from early on in the primary and have stated they are voting for a President not voting on the basis of Christianity. It will be interesting to see how these views evolve as we move forward in the election season.   ****I answered this earlier today but put it in the wrong spot as a blog post.  See above.  I apologize!', \"My friend patty she is a chaplain. She thought it was out of control.  The lies, hatred. Yes, her faith says they don’t get too involved in politics or war as she is Mennonite.  She also said if trump claims to be Christian she won’t call him a liar.  And lots of people say they are and act the same way.  She thinks Hillary is a liar. she doesn’t like or agree with trumps views behavior or hatred.  She doesn't believe in violence and trump encourages violence. [Why would she not call Trump a liar if he says he is a Cristian and what makes her believe Clinton is a liar?] Um I think what I meant to say is she might not believe he’s a Christian but she won’t call him a liar for that since she doesn’t believe in saying someone anyone is lying regarding their faith.  She said a lot of people claim to be of faith but their behavior and actions show different.  She said who am I to say they are regarding their faith.  She thinks Hillary is a lair bout ethics not about her faith.\", \"I visited with my mother about the upcoming election. She's very disappointed by the quality of the two candidates and sees the tone of the election as unpleasant. Neither candidate fits in with her beliefs or ideals. I believe her faith leads her to expect moral behavior from others as she would expect from those around her. Her faith leads her to disagree, like I do, about Donald Trump's comments about refusing Muslim immigrants. As part of an older generation whose faith teaches them, she disagrees with same sex marriages which is of course a political and social hot button. In that way, her faith definitely influences her political beliefs. Also of topic was the funding of Planned Parenthood and the legalities of abortions. In this way, our conversation was swayed by her religious beliefs that influence her political leanings.\", \"I had a conversation with two people a friend and a workplace acquaintance. They were in agreement that the tone of the presidential election especially in the last week that it is full of vitriol and out of control rage. And it is disconcerting. We talked about that internal barometer that a persons of faith can rely on as an anchor of sorts. we said that faith is sorely missing and is much needed faith tolerance and respect. [I understand you all believe that faith is missing from this election, and I wish to ask what everyone would need to hear or relate to from the candidates to be reassured that they possess faith, tolerance, and respect? If the candidates can demonstrate these qualities, would they have to parallel your own personal beliefs or do they just need to possess them? How do they feel religion plays a part?] This is the second time I'm responding to this follow up question so sure hope it posts this time :) no the candidates don't have to mirror my own personal religious beliefs however it is important to me that they exhibit a measure of faith and demonist such .... I personally believe faith serves as an anchor and although our democracy is based on freedom to practice any religion you desire it's important to me they at although they don't practice publicly that they process these attributes internally and embrace faith based morals\", 'I had a conversation with 2 of my friends about the candidates. They also think that Trumps re-tweets things from the supremacists and neo-Nazis.  They also feel that he is running a dirty campaign, by bashing Clinton whenever he can. They are also pro-Israel. Our faith never was discussed. [I understand they are pro-Israel, did your friends express how being pro-Israel impacts who they are supporting?] Yes because of our faith.  Since the people of Israel are the chosen ones.', 'I had a conversation with my 20-year-old son. He sees the tone of the presidential election as \"sad\" and \"scary.\" His sentiments pretty much mirror my own - he doesn\\'t necessarily think Trump is honest and refined enough for the job, but knows for a fact that the depth of Clinton\\'s lies are incomparable to the point where she is unelectable. His faith plays a huge role in the way he lives day-to-day, so his words are spoken from the heart and with love. His faith, like mine, leads him to think an honest and sincere candidate like Ted Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson or even Rick Santorum would have been so much better.', \"my neighbor Judy and I talk a lot about the country and the presidential election. She lives a few doors down from me and is a person of faith. She happens to agree with a lot of my believes. We are both sick of the way the country is headed and with the government that has been running it. Neither one of us considered faith in our decision. We are both more concerned with getting someone into office that isn't afraid to fight back against all the evil coming our way. [What evil do you and your friend believe is coming to the United States? How do you believe Trump or Clinton will deal with those evils and why one candidate is better than the other?] I think Donald Trump will be tougher on the terrorists. Hillary is going to owe other countries to many favors because she has been accepting donations from them. she is all for letting anyone into this country before we have a solid plan to screen them. we let to many evil people into this country. I think Donald Trump would protect us more so than Hillary. I've listened to a lot of the debates and speeches and Hillary keeps changing her position on many of her views. she takes money from countries that are cruel to their woman but says she is for woman's rights. when I say evil I am talking about people wanting to harm us just because we are American's.\", ' you are probably aware, Donald Trump has become the Republican nominee for President. Regardless of whether you support him, we are hoping to get some of your initial impressions about Donald Trump.  How do you think you will be personally affected if Donald Trump wins the Presidency?  Please tell us your thinking or reasons for your answer.  What are the biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency? What are the biggest risks of a Trump Presidency? Donald Trump describes himself as a Christian. o   Do you see Trump as a Christian?', \"I don't know that I will personally affected if he becomes president. but I don't think he would be a good leader for our country. I think he will be tougher on illegal immigration, which I do agree with. But I think he will offend a lot of other countries with his brass personality. I also think he is a little too cocky and will try to make too big of changes to things without thinking them all the way thru. I don't think that he acts like Christians are supposed to act. especially with all the name calling he does to others. [Why do you believe you will not be affected if Trump becomes president? How are Christians supposed to act in your opinion and do you believe Trump needs to act that way if he is president?] Christians should try to be respectful of people. and Trump definitely is not. he basically disrespects everyone from immigrants to women and the disabled\", \"I think one of the benefits of having him as a president is his knowledge of big business. He knows how to make money and, somehow, win people over.   I don't understand it, but some people seem to like his style and respect him. The biggest risk is his outspoken way of dealing with people. He says whatever he wants and is not one to be diplomatic. I don't see him as being very religious.\", \"First of I thought why not trump. He is a business man and maybe that’s what this country needs for a change instead of a lying politician so forctaht I think it would be good The prob with trump is he speaks his mind a little too much and other countries will look at him as a joke I’m not sure how Christian he is He does seem to talk a lot of bad about the other candidates. [Does your uncertainty of Trump's Christian values have an impact on your impressions of him?] I guess in a way they do. He does name call and bully which turns me off of thinking him as our country’s leader He does need to act a little more Christian. [In what ways does Trump need to act more Christian?] His words are very harsh He speaks without worrying about who he offends His words against a lot of people are offending He needs to be more respectful He may not like how some people act or look but he doesn’t need to openly put them down We all have our own opinions about people but keep them to yourself Stop badmouthing people openly\", \"I think my taxes I pay will go up because he seems to only be concerned about the rich staying rich. I am in the middle class and I don't think he has my best interests at heart. I also think I will have to pay more for my health insurance because he will get rid of Obamacare. I think Obamacare has reduced the price we all pay for health insurance. The biggest benefit of Trump Being President is that there will be much less illegal immigration. That will be an improvement because the resources will not have to be spent as much on people not paying taxes. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency is that he is a one man show and will not take kindly to others in his camp giving him advice if he does not agree with them. Also, other World Leaders will not respect Trump and may turn against that US. I do not see Trump as a Christian because he does not seem to be willing to help others as Christ wants us to.\", \"I think Donald Trump is a better candidate for presidency then Hillary even though he scares me as well. I don't think much will change for me personally if he becomes the president. I see him in the beginning focusing his attention on what he can handle best which is running a business and expanding. I don't think he'll focus too much on foreign policies first. I think if he wins he's going to focus on bringing back jobs to America that were before sent overseas which would be great if it could actually happen. I'm hoping with his business expertise that he'll tackle the horrible limitations Obama put on small business owners and if anything helps reverse his orders and instill ones that will help grow the small business economy. Another benefit I'm hoping he'll bring to the table is a better method of border watching between us and Mexico. There are just too many stories to share about how scary it can be living so close to the border, which I still have family that does. I would hope he'd start with something else that Obama took away which is Border Patrol financial budgets and staffing. I think Trump will work with the Border Patrol agencies in developing their skills further to help them succeed in keeping the borders safe. A big risk I have with Trump becoming president is his lack of compassion. I don't know how much of this is an act to get covered by the media more, in regards to his blunt remarks but it really does come across that he only cares about his agendas and if you can't per-sway his ideals then it's a lost cause. Also it's been so long since we've had a non-politician in office and although that idea excites me it also terrifies me in is he capable enough to handle foreign leaders. Also I think during his campaign he is making a lot of enemies so assassination could also be a factor with his bold ideas. I don't really see the term Christian as something it once stood for so if Trump describes himself as one just go for it like everyone else does. It saddens me that so many people claim to be Christians but that have never picked up a Bible or even know who Jesus really was. They just know hey this guy Jesus a lot of people claim him as their God so I guess I will too, without ever knowing what he went through. So many people nowadays claim the term Christian but then go ahead and pick what things out of the Bible they want to believe and ignore the rest as if it doesn't exist. Some Christians don't even recognize valid books of the Bible and exclude them in their teachings. Unfortunately, Christianity is getting more and more divided then it ever should have. So I really don't take offense to people who call themselves Christians because I'll believe it in their actions versus their words. So far Trump displays acts of Christianity such as when he donated a lot of money to the veterans during one of his campaign runs.\", \"I think that it will personally affect me when I visit a hospital for care because he will do away with Obamacare. If I need to visit a hospital I will not have to wait because all the rooms won't be full with people who don't need to be there, but go anyways because of the healthcare for everyone currently. My life would directly improve. The biggest benefits of his presidency includes no more Obamacare, a complete different direction for the country which we need, less illegal immigration using our benefits for free when he have homeless people, and putting our needs first. The biggest risks include if we have a relationship with North Korea, will other countries see that as treason? Will his candid mouth get him into trouble with our allies? I see him as a Christian because he does want good for this country. He wants to make the country better by making our own things, thus creating jobs. He wants us to stop helping others who should be secondary to the list when our own people should be put first like our homeless. We have spent so much resources and money helping other countries when we have people starving here and homeless. The reason he is so passionate about his ideas is because he values America and the citizens.\", 'From a personal perspective I feel like a Trump Presidency will adversely affect me from a financial perspective.  He has discussed re-vamping Social Security which with definitely affect me.  I am 60 years old and can retire at 66 and 2 months but he had said that the age to receive full Social Security should be increased.  Unfortunately, most Americans still rely on these benefits for retirement. Trump is an astute businessman and our country could be served well if it were run like a business.  He is a great negotiator and salesman which will help our country internationally when presented with opportunities for such discussions.  His negotiating skills will also help him when dealing with Congress. Trump is arrogant, abrasive, and generally a bully.  He doesn\\'t care about being liked and, in fact, seems to thrive on being disliked.  This personality trait has and will continue to offend others.  Imagine what will happen when he pulls this abrasiveness at a G7 Summit.  What an embarrassment to the US! I certainly can\\'t say one way or the other whether Trump is a Christian.  That would be judging.  However, he doesn\\'t seem to hold the same Christian beliefs I do.  He flip-flops on the abortion issue to suit whatever his political agenda is at the moment.  Today he is pro-life but previously he wasn\\'t.  He stereotypes ethnic groups.  He is condescending to everyone it seems.  He often says \"I love the _______ people.\"  That statement alone is perceived to be condescending to groups different than himself.', 'I\\'m not entirely sure how I will be personally affected by a Trump Presidency. My gut reaction is that he will cause lots of chaos, economically, environmentally, and with foreign relations. I fear there are no benefits to a Trump Presidency except that it would eliminate another Clinton Presidency. The biggest risk with Trump is his unpredictability. He is constantly saying things and then backtracking, claiming he never said it in the first place. I believe the man lack diplomacy which is crucial in a President especially while dealing in foreign relations particularly with the current political climate in the middle east. I\\'m afraid Trump will say or do something that will lead us to war. Though he may claim to be a Christian, his Christianity does not show. I am not God; I cannot speak to the man\\'s soul. But from an outside view I do not believe he is truly a Christian. [Could you please elaborate as to why the only benefit you see to Trump being president is that it would eliminate another Clinton Presidency if you believe he would cause \"lots of chaos, economically, environmentally, and with foreign relations,\" along with the other risks you mentioned. If you believe he is not Christian, what kind of impact does that have on you? Some individuals also believe Trump could lead the US into conflicts with other nations or jeopardize our homeland security. Why do you think then he is still an attractive candidate to voters?] I think the only benefit to trump being president is that Hillary will not be president. I am not a fan of her politics either.   His lack of Christianity doesn\\'t really have an effect on me. I think it does lead to a lack of morals on his part but there have been other presidents in the past who I doubt were truly Christians but they still had a better moral center than trump.   I think his followers are attracted to him for bad reasons. Many of them agree with trumps racist views and he\\'s the first candidate to ever be so clearly bigoted. Sadly, there are many people in America who are just as bigoted so they find him attractive.', \"I feel like I have no idea what Trump will actually do if elected president.  His words and policy's seem to be designed to get the biggest shock value possible.  As such I expect his actions as president would be the same.  I'm scared of what that would do.  What I do know is that if Trump was elected president and followed through on his current ideas I would be scared to be a woman, scared to have health conditions, scared to be a working class American, and scared to have friends who are not white.  The risks of a Trump presidency are total economic collapse and perhaps civil war.  The certainty is racist, sexist, classist policies.  I see no benefits at all to a Trump Presidency.  He is not a Christian man.  He is not even a moral man.  He's a performer looking to get the biggest following by amusing the crowd the most.  Anyone can say they're Christian but if your policies are not compassionate and understanding of human strife then you are not Christian and not fit to lead anyone.\", 'If Trump wins I see a major change in funding for Dept. of Education, as I have a school age child. Other issues are extreme which would not personally affect me (I.e. Gay marriage/anti-abortion/no government investment in retirement funds/etc.). Benefits are that he is a savvy business man. Risks are his traits; my way or highway idea. He does not embody a bipartisan party member. Does not have public resume of service like Hillary. Does not appear as particularly Christian in verse or political demeanor.', \"I think that having Donald Trump has president can have its advantages and disadvantages. He certainly is a trendsetter with a lot of good ideas yet at the same time I am embarrassed at his outlandish behavior when I listen to him inappropriately pontificate about opponents, racial classifications and situations. I am afraid that he will lower the perception of the presidency and our nation.  I would desire for him to get trained on how to professionally speak in public and present reasonable policies without offending groups of people. I find it hard to believe at times that he is a well-educated, successful business man with an impressive family and how he got so far with the way he presents himself to the American public.  He can be shocking.  On the other hand, I admire the fact he has shaken up the political establishment in a way that has brought scrutiny to the 'old ways of doing political business' and that is why he is popular. If he can be a catalyst for change and a visionary for the future, then I want him to do these things but in a manner that does not offend others.  He has gotten all of our attention but I don't want him to waste our time without providing substance to what he promises. I want him to be able to delegate to others to make change come about but do it in a manner that is exemplary for our country and youth.  If he continues in the path of offensiveness, then I think our nation loses credibility and a sense of worth.  Our citizens will then think that being offensive is 'ok' and it's not.  When the issue of practicing one's faith comes to mind for Donald Trump I really don't associate practicing religion with him at all.  I think of him as a business man but not as a man of faith.  I really know nothing of his religious affiliation.  He has raised an impressive family so there must be a value system that he attests to; however, his treatment of other people doesn't correlate to faith based principles. I realize that he must act in a certain way to 'shock' the American people in order to gain their attention but I personally believe that he needs to 'tone' it down a bit and act/speak in a more professional tone.\", \"I really don't see my life being affected if Trump is elected other then setting women’s rights back 50 years. Mr. Trump seems to think women should be at home with babies and not making choices of their own or in a beauty contest. I see no benefit for Mr. Trump being President and I have tried to look, read and listen to a benefit and I see none. I see nothing but a big risk if he became President as he does not get along well with some of the other leaders of other countries (some even will not allow him into their countries) he has stated that he believes in nuclear war and that he knows more about IS then any General does. Mr. Trump does not have any background in politics which at one time I thought would be a good thing but after hearing him speak I don't think so now. Mr. Trump wants it his way or no way which means that him and Congress would be butting heads all the time and no laws would get passed and he would try and fire each and every one that disagreed with him and he would not understand that he did not have the power to do that. Mr. Trump is a Christian? I must have missed when he said that one but then again I tune him out with all the cussing he does. Hmm Mr. Trump as a Christian... he has been married how many times?? Cusses?? Runs a shady investment schooling company?? Degrades people?? Caught in lies and had to back track how many times?? Would you want to have him speak at your church with children there? I have to say that no way that I can see Mr. Trump as a good practicing Christian. [I understand your position on Trump, but I am curious to know if there is anything you could read, listen, or look at that would convince you otherwise that he would make an effective President? Do you believe he is capable of making changes in his behavior to demonstrate he could be an effective leader?  Setting aside what you have already stated about Trump, you believe he is not Christian, does that impact your view of him?] Mr. Trump not acting in what I would think is a moral Christian matter is one of the main reasons I don't think he would make a good President along with his ever changing temperament. In all the time Mr. Trump has been on the campaign trail his temperament and judgement has just gone downhill and I doubt that anyone can help him change or at least tone down his comments and help him focus on the major issues.\", 'If Donald Trump were to be elected my gut feeling is that he would have a negative impact upon me personally. This negative impact could be in the form of higher taxes, no health insurance, loss of a job or any number of other negative happenings that could be directly contributed to Donald Trump becoming President. (Example: Another country becomes so outraged that he is elected, that they plan an attack). I do not see any benefit of a Trump Presidency. I only see negativity if he were elected. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency would be that congress and the senate would be so busy in fighting that nothing would get done. The other risk is that other countries would not support Trump/America politics. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency is that he will anger some extremist group and they would plan an attack. I do not see Trump as a Christian. He does not display Christian values. He has been married 3 times, cheated on his first wife, cheats in his business dealings, I do not feel he is honorable.', \"I don't think I will be personally affected too much because the President really does not have total control or power over issues.  It is handled by Congress who passes the bills. The biggest benefits are that he is a business man who hopefully could handle the national debt better than the previous presidents. The risks are he seems like he is someone you cannot trust.  He is a bully who seems to have no idea of what the issues are for the average American.  He is only for the rich. He does describe himself as a Christian but he does not practice what he preaches.  I saw him mock someone with a disability.  He has absolutely no compassion and that is very scary for a leader of a country.  He also said he was pro-choice but then when he wanted the endorsement of the religious right he changed his mind and now he is pro-life.  He goes with whoever can do the most for him.\", 'I think Trump wants America to start looking at our own problems at home and concentrate more on rebuilding and preserving America. But in doing so he brings the biggest risks of putting America in one of the biggest recessions, even bigger then the great depression it is being said. Possibly 9.4 million jobs will or could be lost which affects the working class that support him the most. That affects everybody. I have had a hard enough time as it is getting a new job but with that man y more people at a loss of a job it could get pretty scary. His economic proposals are super risky. Also the strong language Trump has used towards Mexico and China could ultimately lead to a huge trade war. I don’t see Trump as a Christian at all. He doesn’t embody the Christian spirit or true beliefs.', \"I would like to think that a Trump presidency would be net beneficial to me and my family.  I think that his policies would be divisive, and would either garner strong support or opposition from citizens, but I'm hoping that the balance would be a net positive.  One of the biggest benefits from a Trump presidency would be a strengthening of the United States as a whole on the world stage.  In recent years, the reputation of our country has fallen greatly, with our allies no longer feeling like they can count on us for support, and our enemies no longer fearing us as a superior force.  I would hope that President Trump would be able to remedy this situation. With this recommitment to global power comes many risks as well.  One big one would be how our enemies react to this resurgence of power and authority on the world stage.  Already, forces are using a distributed style of fighting that makes them harder to defeat.  Add to this the boom in immigration to the United States from all over the globe, and it could realistically be a scenario that fighting would start domestically.  I hope this is not the case, but our world seems primed for this sort of event. I am not a good of a Christian as I strive to be, and I would imagine that Trump is not either.  I have heard him state that he is a Presbyterian, and I would hope that some sort of religious underpinning would guide his decisions, despite his outward rhetoric and appearance.  I feel like we will be in need of a strong leader in the coming years, and a moral compass to guide us will be crucial. (Male)\", \"I work at a Bilingual Tax office, and to be honest most of our clients are immigrants. Along with my business being majorly effected, I have friends and co-workers who could be deported because of Trump's arrogance. I think the only benefit of Trump becoming president is that he may stop all of the jobs from going overseas, but on the other side of that coin, we will lose so many workers that we will have too many job openings. The biggest risk I see with Trump becoming president is that he may cause us to fight another war, over his non-diplomatic skill set with other countries. He may lead us into a war that would devastate the United States. I do not see him as a Christian, he is hateful and judgmental to almost everyone. Even during his own rallies, he is rude and pig-headed. (Female)\", 'I am still open to changing my mind regarding whom I would vote for. As of now, however, I think I would, in addition to others, would be affected negatively if Donald Trump won the Presidency. While he does speak what he believes to think as true, which I strongly admire, he has farfetched and radical ideas (completely banning Muslims for a temporary period, although he has backtracked on this, etc.). The biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency are that: he would not relent to lobbyists and he would not cower to world leaders. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency are: economics (as he has not given any true details of anything--everything is focused on \"The Wall\", Muslims, and Clinton\\'s e-mails) and relationships within the U.S. whether it be race, gender, or ethnicity (he continuously makes racist and misogynistic remarks). As for seeing Trump as a Christian, I do not believe he is a TRUE Christian. A true Christian does not throw shade at other races or ethnicities. A true Christian does not suppress women. A true Christian does not joke about individuals with special needs. [You mention that what is admirable about Trump is that he speaks his mind, and he does not relent to outside pressures. Some individuals believe this to be a flaw as his words and behaviors could lead the US to conflicts with other nations or jeopardize our homeland security. What are your thoughts on this? How do you believe Trump could use his beliefs and strong will effectively as a leader?] Him speaking his mind and not relenting to outside pressures can definitely be a negative as well; that\\'s for sure! With how outspoken he is, I definitely see that viewpoint as well. In terms of being steadfast in what he believes and not budging with various international or domestic policies, it could be a positive in that he doesn\\'t back down. He has maintained presence throughout the business world with his companies and has made decisions being steadfast before, so I am sure he can carry that with him if he were to win the Presidency. (Male)', \"These are some really great questions. I am a Trump supporter, but for one reason. He is out in the open. I think that if he is elected, then at least I would know what is going on in our country. I think that many people would benefit from his presidency because he is not going to be a puppet. At the same times, this is a bad thing. He would not have to abide by congress or the legislatures, and why? It is because he has so much money. Is he Christian? Well, I believe that he is, but he has done some very unlike Christian things. Nobody is perfect in the least bit. I think that faith, while does matter, is not the main reason to elect the president. They need to be biased, moral, and able to judge diplomatically. [In what ways does a candidate need to be moral, biased, and judge diplomatically? Some individuals believe that his behavior to not be a puppet could lead the US into conflicts with other nations or jeopardize our homeland security. What are your thoughts on this? Could you please elaborate on your comment about Trump's money and why that would be the reason he would not have to abide by Congress or legislatures?] I think that morality should be in every person. That is the sense that they should do what is right and be honest about it. A candidate can, I do apologize, I meant unbiased. They can be this way by simply accepting everyone. What I mean by judge diplomatically is that you should be able to see when people have done wrong, but also be able to see when they have done right and you need to be able to go by the law and not by what you think. I think that he would not have to abide by congress with his money because they could deny something, but he goes behind their backs, vetoes it, or provides the funds to do so. Can this lead to impeachment? Yes, it most certainly can. I do not think that he really cares about that though. I mean he may abide by them, but at the same time he may just as well think that he can do absolutely anything that he wants and get away with it. I think that it could be a threat to homeland security, but only because we may not know where the funds would actually be going. I hope that this cleared things up. Also, it may be a threat because people who think that he will not be a puppet would feel threatened and they would rebel, but I think that they would only be outraged because he is not following the same guidelines as everyone else. This could lead to riots and protests of sorts. He has got to be careful if elected. (Female)\", \"I don't think I will largely be affected if Trump becomes President. I do fear that certain programs will change like the Affordable Care Act that is crucial in making healthcare for my family affordable. Otherwise, I think the main negative affect from Trump will be in regards to international relations and businesses. The biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency would be have a leader who is bold. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency would be international war, increase in poverty, worsened economic circumstances. I do not see the actions of Trump or words of Trump confirming him as a Christian. (Male)\", 'Being from a small town, I do not feel that I will be personally affected by any person elected President, Trump included. I feel that the benefits of a Trump presidency may be job creation, economic stimulus, and protection from terroristic elements abroad and in country. By the same flip of the coin, I worry that Trump\\'s quote unquote \"protection measures\" may result in civil rights infringement. Also, Trump very well may be a Christian. You can have religious beliefs or leanings, and still be \"politically incorrect\" or offensive to someone in your day-to-day remarks, that doesn\\'t necessarily make you a sacrilegious or unholy person. We are all only human. [Why do you believe being from a small town you feel you will not be personally affected by who becomes President? You state that Trump\\'s policies may lead to civil rights infringements, why do you believe he is still an attractive candidate to voters? It seems that Christian values do not want to jeopardize civil rights. What is your opinion as to why some Christians believe he is the right candidate?] Ultimately, in light of the large number of American citizens, I feel quit insignificant in the grand scheme of things.   2. There is currently a high degree of tension in this nation, be it based on race, politics, religion, or some other human facet. I sometimes feel that Trump makes fiery statements, but that he is simply posturing for his audience.  However, should he come to power and actually get his policies into effective practice, they may or mayn\\'t be infringing towards whatever group they\\'re targeting. Voters back him, however, because they view his show of take-action strength as a means towards national security.    3. Christians may find him attractive because they hold opinions which may literally align with (their individual interpretations) of Biblical doctrine.  Due to the age of the Bible\\'s authorship, certain passages are probably likely to be misconstrued, or more appropriately, lost in the translations which are jaded by 21st century \"logic” or ideology. In this sense, such interpretation may translate roughly, bringing a brusque \"offensive\" to whichever group is in question. (Male)', \"I think I will be personally affected if his decisions are damaging in terms of expanding the powers of the presidency and throwing the balance of powers of course even more than it already is (with Bush and Obama). I am fearful of the overuse of executive actions to do that because ultimately that takes away freedom and that has an impact on individuals, obviously. I think that if he proves capable of leading economically, of stopping illegal immigration, and of not engaging in empire-building foreign wars that are not necessary, that could strengthen the economy, directly impacting me, and give people like me more hope in the future of the country. I think the biggest benefits are the ones just stated: potentially strengthening the economy, no empire-building foreign wars, and stopping illegal immigration. I find the biggest risks of a Trump presidency the overuse of executive authority, whether by executive orders or other means. I am of course equally fearful of this with Clinton though. I find the risk of a tyrant in either of them very large. I am doubtful that Trump is a Christian. I of course don't think anyone can know for sure where another spiritually is at. People who you wouldn't expect to be can be Christians, and people who claim to be aren't necessarily. Trump has said that when asked if he ever repented of anything that he never did because he had nothing to repent of. If that was said in jest, and perhaps it was, then that's no indicator. But if he really meant it then he is not a Christian. To be a Christian you must recognize that you have sinned and that Christ has to provide a covering for those sins in order for you to have eternal life. But I wasn't there, perhaps those words were just said in jest. I wouldn't guess it from his rude and sometimes crude behavior, but some Christians aren't as mature as others - behaving badly doesn't mean you're not a Christian. Some just haven't had much spiritual growth, and it just takes the faith the size of a mustard seed to be a Christian. (Female)\", 'The only way I feel I would be personally affected is with his plans on reforming health care. Many of the issues he is adamant about would honestly have little effect on my life in general. I think the biggest benefits of having Trump in office is that he will not lie as much as others have. I also feel he is concerned with issues that concern America, such as health care, very deeply. I think he will go the extra mile and really try to solve this issue and other issues that are currently being neglected and will try to turn the country around from the direction it is going to a much more prosperous future. The risks I see are his eccentric behavior. I am worried he will be quick to go to war with other countries if he is threatened. I also worry about how far he will really go with his immigration and deportation plans. I think if he \"builds a wall\" and deports a lot of people, it will go against what the country was founded on. Though I do see it as necessary to an extent, I am worried about how the job market and economy will react. If he states he is Christian, I am no one to judge or say that he is not. No one but him and the Lord knows what he truly feels in his heart. I know a lot of negative views of him are out there for some of the things he says and some of the ways he acts. Some of these things could be easily considered not Christian but, once again, if he says he is Christian then he is in my eyes. (Male)', \"I think if Trump wins, our economy will improve. I believe that will have a strong impact on everyone's lives. It is one of the biggest reasons I am voting for him. I also believe that we as a nation will be more secure with Trump as president. And although that might not seem like an obvious day to day difference, it will affect us. The benefits are exactly what I mentioned above. I believe our economy will grow, we will be more secure, and our borders will be more secure. The risks are few in my opinion. However, they are potentially large. I feel like his largest risk is his cockiness in international policy. If he mouths off to the wrong person and speaks from the hip in anger...we could find ourselves in a rather dangerous position. I don't know honestly. He claims to be, and some people that know him better than I do say he is. But he doesn't always act the part. I cannot see into a man's heart especially when I don't know him personally. I have my doubts about his beliefs, but I also give him the benefit of the doubt (Male)\", 'Personally affected: I don\\'t immediately foresee any damages or changes to my daily life (ie I am a US citizen so I won\\'t be on any no fly lists or deportation). Quality of life could change though. I\\'m not sure about what he thinks he\\'s going to change or do for Americans. The benefits of a Trump presidency: Again, I don\\'t really see what benefits to my life there will be. I haven\\'t seen any reason to believe that things are going to be much different. Laws still have to move through the senate; the Supreme Court will stay make their decisions. Biggest Risks: I feel like a Trump presidency is going to downgrade American appeal. Between him and his wife I think the White House will look like a Las Vegas act. As a born-again Christian I have to concede that the Bible teaches that \"man looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks at the heart.\" I can\\'t see Trump\\'s heart. Maybe he is a Christian. However, the Bible also teaches that when someone believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior they will have a change of heart. I don\\'t agree that he lives by Christian morals and that makes it difficult to believe him when he claims to be a Christian. (Female)', \"I think that the only area that a Trump Presidency would affect me directly is in terms of the cost of imported goods that I purchase. Trump frequently flip-flops and is unclear about his stance on a lot of issues, but I feel that he has explicitly promoted a protectionist trade policy. Raising tariffs on imported goods will make the otherwise cheap goods that I buy from abroad, specifically East Asia, more expensive. The one benefit I can think of that may result from a Trump Presidency is increased privatization of Social Security. I think that I would be able to personally invest the money that I pay towards Social Security with greater confidence that it will have appreciated in value by the time I want to retire. The second benefit I see to Trump being in office is a smaller likelihood that we will become involved in foreign entanglements, which we have seen plenty of during the Obama and Bush administrations. One risk I see to a Trump Presidency is an increased likelihood that personal liberties will be eroded at home, which is made evident by his support for spying on those who he sees as potential terrorists. Secondly, I think that environmental policy will take a step backward during a Trump Presidency, as he has expressed a dislike for alternative energy and institutions like the EPA. Third, and probably the biggest risk that I see, is an increased strain on race relations and a general divisive tone across the nation. I can't imagine a President of the United States saying the sort of things that Trump has said on the campaign trail regarding minorities and other groups of people. I recognize that Trump identifies as a Christian, but I do not see him as a Christian for a couple of reasons. First, he has said in interviews that he has never asked God for forgiveness of his sins, nor does he feel the need to. I think that this goes against the core beliefs of any mainstream denomination of Christianity. One cannot be a Christian if he or she does not accept salvation by asking for the forgiveness of sins. What use is Christ's death and resurrection if it does not cover one's sins? This is a major problem with his claiming to be a Christian. Secondly, his behavior and words, again, the way he ridicules minorities, women, and the afflicted, do not reflect the life of someone who is in Christ. I do not see Trump as a Christian, and I frankly find his masquerading as a Christian and pandering to Christians extremely offensive. One specific example of this can be seen in his speech at Liberty University where he mispronounced the name of a book of the Bible and proceeded read scripture that he clearly has no connection to, all in the name of seeking political gain. (Male)\", \"The US will radically change if he becomes president because he will implement crazy ideas whenever possible. My life personally will not be affected a whole lot aside from maybe taxes. The biggest benefits are that he doesn't support gay marriage or the foolishness of allowing transgender to go to whichever bathroom they want. The biggest risks are war and calamity. Trump does not seem afraid to push the big red button. He will go to war with China and Russia at the same time and not even break a sweat. He is a businessman that is too used to steamrolling everyone but the US isn't as smart and powerful as it used to be. Donald trump fails to accurately describe himself. He is not a Christian or a God fearing man in any type of way. He does not follow Christ which is the definition of a Christian. (Male)\", 'If Donald Trump were to the win the election the biggest immediate change for me will be a slight decrease in my taxes, and probably the ability for my fiancé and I to keep more of our income once we are married. From a social standpoint I\\'m honestly not sure. The reality is most of the changes he wants are still going to have to get through congress, and at this point people seem to have lost a significant amount of respect for him, so I believe his influence will be far less than most people expect it to be, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. The biggest benefits of Trumps presidency mostly center around the fact he is not tied down to congress, he will stand up for what he believes in, but also listen to the people on votes. I think his independence of the system is what will set him apart as an appropriate president. The biggest risk I see with Trump is going to be how he handles foreign policy, and if he will be able to work with our allies even if they don\\'t do things the same way he wants to do them. When it comes to faith, Donald Trump is not a Christian, he is not a born again follower of Jesus Christ, and the only relationship he has to the name \"Christian\" is nominal in nature. He does not exude the fruit of the spirit. (Male)', \"I will be embarrassed that such a clown is in the White House. He seems so childish, and he is so stubborn in his beliefs that he even refuses to listen to people who believe something else in a reasonable manner. The only plus to a Trump presidency is that he might help to conserve a more conservative leaning in the House and Senate. The risks are that he's going to bully his way through the presidency. He's had so much power in the way he does business, that it's going to transfer into the presidency. I don't see Trump as a Christian. There's no way he acts and treats people the way he does and be a man of the Christian faith. (Female)\", \"I am smack dab in the middle class, so I don't think Trump would affect me economically at all. The thing that scares me the most is that fact that he doesn't seem to be taking things seriously. I'm afraid what he's saying will negative effect other countries' opinions of us causing a war. 2) He seems to be pretty honest. He also has a good business sense and could hopefully work on the deficit. 3) He's arrogant and rude...especially to immigrants. I do think he's right in the sense that there needs to be stricter guidelines as far as who comes into the country, but he's being really offensive and people aren't hearing his real points. They're only focusing on his negative comments. 4) A Christian? Maybe. A good Christian? No. Just because you go to church and believe in God doesn't make you a good Christian. You need to live a positive, non-judgmental life (or at least make an effort to do this) which he is not doing at all. (Female)\", 'I have no idea how I will be personally affected or if I will be affected if Trump is elected president. I\\'m guessing that my individual life may not change much if any with the exception of taxes potentially going up. I think Trump would cause taxes to go up because of his plan to increase border and immigration controls and restrictions. The biggest benefit of a Trump presidency is security for America and a focus on improving our economy and hopefully our outlook over ALL. If he is smart, He will delegate the task of \" making America Great Again\" to others who can do just that and appoint the key people as military, security, economic advisors and finally, a trustworthy person just to help him keep himself out of trouble with the media and others. Trump knows how to work the legal and tax systems in place and how to take advantage of loopholes in the law and constitution. My hope is that he will use these skills to help make America Great again. The biggest risk of Trump as president, would be whether he can keep his cool in confrontations with other world leaders in order to prevent WWIII from being unintentially ignited. There is also the risk that Trump will find every way possible to benefit himself and his own businesses at the expense of taxpayers. Christian? He may be a Christian by default, since he\\'s not Muslim or Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist or whatever. He supposedly doesn\\'t drink or smoke or do drugs and believes in a \"Higher Power\" but his over the top lifestyle (including multiple marriages and divorces) of excess and lack of moderation and well, \"slick\" if not \"slimy\" exterior does not reflect anything Christian to me. If he were in the military and had to put a religious affiliation on his dog tags, I would expect it would be stamped Protestant Christian and that\\'s about it, the extent of his faith as I see it. Donald Trump a Christian? Are you kidding? What\\'s in his heart may be very different, but from what I have seen and heard, I don\\'t think Donald Trump could pray his way out of a paper bag!', \"Well its little scary to think if he becomes president.  I think it will give more hate groups power.  I have 2 half black children and a Puerto Rican husband and a child with him .so who knows what craziness he will start.  I find no benefit for him to be our president.  He couldn’t even run his own business how can he run our country?  Bankruptcy after bankruptcy.  He treated his employees like crap.  We will have a lot of problems with other countries if he wins. Our military will be fighting everyone.  More money wasted on war.  No I definitely don't see him as a Christian.  His wife isn’t good enough to a first lady.  Naked pictures playboy.  No not tasteful at all.\", \"I think if Trump becomes president we will be in a war in less than four years. Also we will lose a lot of our alias just because he is so blunt. He is not one to not say how he feel. It will affect a lot of government programs. Meaning welfare social security benefits. I am on ssi due to seizures. I'm terrified that my insurance will be affected. The biggest benefits would be he would try to cut back on the refugee's coming in our country. And he would make it harder for people to get government benefits. I fought for four years for mine. I find it very annoying when someone comes from a different country and gets welfare right away. The risks are being at war. He has a don't give a damn attitude and a leap first without thinking about it first. Also assignation someone trying to kill him. He again speaks like he is predijust. I think he would bring terror attacks from other countries and it would be a mess. As for him being Christian he doesn't act like one. A Christian is to be Christ like he is far from that.\", \"As a celebrity, Trump was amusing. I used to watch the Apprentice for the first few years. Being the president of the United States is different though. He is rude and crude and offends everyone. If he is elected, how will other countries see us? Will we become a joke or will people be so offended by him that they stop dealing with us? These are things that may not seem to affect my day to day, but they will definitely affect my life. It is scary to think how much power we may give him! The benefits of a Trump presidency seem to be few. Hopefully, he will get things done that have not been done. He does not think like a normal politician as he is not one, so hopefully he will see things that need to change and do them. I hope he creates jobs and takes care of Americans. He has never been afraid to speak his mind, so I hope he will use that to America's advantage. That being said, he is dividing the nation with his speech. He is racist and sexist and against immigration-the very thing that this country was built on. I am praying that he is acting this way and exaggerating his personality in order to get attention during the election process. I really don't think he thought he would get this far, but now he does not want to lose. I am not sure he really wanted to be president! I hope that if he is elected, he will settle down and be a business man again. If Donald Trump says he is a Christian, I have no way of knowing if he is or not. I cannot see inside his heart. I pray he is and that he begins to act like one. I pray he believes in Jesus and that his heart is softened to this country and what we need. He needs to listen to his Creator and use wisdom in his choices. As of right now however, I do not see him acting like a Christian.\", \"If Trump wins, I believe the country in general will change a lot. I see him as running the nation as he would a business. The rich will become richer the poor will become poorer. I will become poorer. He seems to be all about money. I think if he becomes president there will be a huge reform with the welfare system which may be good, it could potentially stop those who are abusing the system. However, it could also hurt those who really do need the assistance. I do not see Trump as a Christian. He is like most American's who claim to be Christian but are nowhere near what the Bible would describe as Christian. Trump has offended many with things he has said, when he speaks he does not show a Christian attitude of love for others. Just because a person claims to be Christian does not make them a Christian.\", \"I don't know how I might be affected if Donald Trump wins the presidency. I would hope that the economy would be stimulated and that the whole economy would basically pick up. This would change my life. As I mentioned before, we have a business and all of the relevant parts of this business are still around waiting to be picked up. The only thing we lack is customers. If the customers come back, then I can start building towards a middle-class existence again. Perhaps my husband would be able to quit his low-paying service job. That is how I hope it would be affected. And if not that then I hope that I would pay less in taxes because we are making just less and less and less every year for the past several years now.\", 'The biggest benefit to that Donald Trump could give me is to restart the economy so we can be in control of our lives again and run our own business as we desire to. This country needs a middle class. Whatever needs to be done to bring it back this should be done as soon as possible. Otherwise more and more people are just going to be in my position.', \"The biggest risk with this President, is the same as it is with any president. And that risk is that we will get into a long expensive War with another country. The ultimate nightmare scenario would be nuclear war. No I don't think this would happen. But nobody thought that we were going to go to war with bush W was elected. That was a big surprise. You just never can know.\", \"If Trump wins the presidency, it's hard to say exactly how that would affect me personally.  On one hand, I live in a southern border state, based on his stance on illegal immigration, I may see differences in how our borders are maintained, which could mean more security in my state.  On the other hand, he is a rich business man, and I worry that he can't relate to a blue collar family like mine, and that will show in how he handles taxes and healthcare.  I feel like foreign policy is a big risk with a Trump presidency.  Trump has a strong presence, most people either love him or hate him and he doesn't seem to care either way.  I worry that he could make the wrong people angry and cause a strain in our relationship with other countries. Donald Trump's faith is very hard to read for me, it's easy to call himself a Christian, but he's blunt and opinionated and doesn't apologize for that.  I question whether a man that would call a woman a dog on national tv, has any faith at all. [Many individuals have stated that they believe Trump's actions and behavior could lead the US into conflicts with other nations and cause homeland security issues. What are your thoughts as to why individuals still find him as an attractive candidate even though he could lead the US into the situations you described?] I think people just find him different!  He's not polished like other politicians, he's not rehearsed, he has knee jerk reactions in public forums and people relate to that.  I also think many people mistake his bluntness for honesty.  They think because he presents himself the way he does, he must be telling the truth.\", \"I don't know if I will be personally affected if Trump wins the Presidency, but I suspect that my job in education will be affected in terms of policy. I also suspect that my health care costs may be affected. The biggest benefit of a Trump Presidency would be the possibility of a more balanced budget. The biggest risk that I see is the possibility of his foreign policy (or lack thereof) becoming a security hazard for our nation. No. I do not see Trump as a Christian. I think he puts people down, talks in circles, and is not trustworthy---none of those things point to Christianity for me.\", 'I think I would be personally affected if Donald Trump wins the election in several ways.  First, I would feel safer because I trust him to secure the border and take a stronger stand against ISIS terrorists and other radical Islam.  Second, I hope he would improve the economy through more conservative economic principles and that could result in improved wages through growth of the economy.  Third, I would expect him to appoint more conservative Supreme Court Justices and this would result in me feeling more comfortable with the outstanding court cases and any unforeseen court cases.  Lastly, I would anticipate he would balance the budget and begin deficit reduction and this would improve my children\\'s future which brings me some comfort. The biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency is he has a history as a successful businessman and CEO and I suspect this experience could be good for America.  He also has indicated he plans to take strong stances on immigration and terrorism and this is definitely needed in our country.  He has a Spiritual Advisory Board and I think this will benefit him in his selections of Supreme Court Justices.  Also, the country will benefit from his pro-America stance in all areas. It could also be a benefit that he is an outsider when it comes to Washington politics and he has never dealt with lobbyists or special interest groups. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency is what I just mentioned as a possible benefit---he has never held a political office before and does not have a record for us to judge.  I am concerned that he has donated to Democrats in the past and I am also concerned he will be willing to negotiate on issues that he should take a hard stance on.  Another risk is how he is going to be viewed by other governments.  He has made big promises to the American people and he will need to work hard to accomplish them if elected. As I said in a previous post, man cannot judge the heart of man, only God.  However, Scripture also tells us you can judge a Christian by the fruit he produces.  Donald Trump has professed that he is a Christian.  My concerns is that he said he has done nothing that needs forgiveness.  For me, the first step to a saving relationship with Jesus Christ is to admit that you are a sinner, born into sin as stated in Romans that \"all have fallen short of the glory of God.\" This concerns me about Trump\\'s testimony.  However, I recently read James Dobson describe him as an immature Christian.  I know from my own personal relationship with Christ that I have matured through sanctification by studying God\\'s Word.  So, is he a Christian? I\\'m not sure but I do pray he has a saving faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.', \"With a Trump presidency I don't see my life changing much.  If he does his job right, life should carry on without him being in the news much. I think one of the biggest benefits of a Trump presidency is that the Obamacare legislation will be revisited and revised. I also think he'll address Islamic terrorism. One of the biggest risks of a Trump presidency is that he'll go back to being a loose cannon and continue to insult people. I know he claims to be a Christian, a lot of people claim the same thing and use it as an umbrella term, but I don't see him that way.\", \"I doubt I will be personally affected if Donald Trump wins the election. I might be disappointed by my fellow Americans, but I'll be disappointed by them no matter who wins this election because of the candidates. I live in a smaller town where things stay much the same and do not work in a position likely to be directly affected by the outcome. I think the benefits to his potential presidency could be the changes to our health care system. He sees the flaws in Obamacare and as someone whose employer sponsored health insurance tripled as a result, I would like to see changes! As a married couple household, I also see the benefits to lower taxes on working families which would be funded by higher taxes on high incomes. I can also see the benefits of his stance on a waiting period for guns and banning assault weapons. I see the risk of his presidency as him. I think he is very tactless and cannot imagine hi putting his ego aside to do what is best for our country. I feel he would be a risk in his behavior toward presidents, diplomats and high ranking officials of other countries. I don't see him as a Christian. Some of his statements (i.e. About banning Muslim immigrants and sending illegals away) speak to his not having a heart for Christ. His personal life with multiple divorces and remarriages also speaks to him not following.\", \"Today I have such mixed feelings about Donald trump my feelings surrounding him from the past up till very recently has been impacted by the turmoil and lack of respect I've witnessed. I watched his speech last night in Ohio and was flabbergasted at his attitude I reach my children to respect others and respect difference of opinion what has unfolded I've the last few days in real time and the commentary on social media is distributed death threats personal attacks ... How I'll if affect me I don't know how it will at this moment in time -- a non-Washington perspective business success fresh ideas biggest risks ... His dismissiveness of inappropriate actions comments and his kinship with white supremest groups they feel as if he is speaking in code to them and he hasn't strongly condemned them .... So it's s concern if he takes that attitude into the White House in would like him to consenteste on issues they are affecting my and others do is we him as a Christian .... Yes, but not necessarily a man of strong faith. [I understand you watched Trump's speech in Ohio and have mix feelings about him. As the election continues, what would you need to hear or relate to from either of the candidates to feel more reassured? You believe that Trump is not a man of strong faith, does this belief impact you significantly or are other risks more impacting?] The thing is if he is a man who respects and practices faith it has become increasingly difficult to observe that .... I need to see integrity and a shift in the tone it's difficult to get past this excessive vitriol and consider the real issues facing the country .... I think faith AIDS you at time like this so I would need to see along with traditional positions on issues facing the county and the world a concrete demonstration of Faith's tenants\", \"I think I would be affected by a downturn in the economy, as his ideas regarding economic protectionism will only harm the United states.  I think the biggest benefit of a Trump presidency will be a decrease in terrorism.  The biggest risk would be to the economy and to conservatism as a movement or faction of the Republican party. Whether he's is Christian or not is purely between him and God, but as the bible says, he will be judged by his fruit.\", \"I think that he might cut Medicare benefits, because he's all about the wealthy people like himself.  This will affect myself as I'm disabled, also my parents as well. the biggest benefit would be that he would work on keeping illegals from coming into our country, which would save the government a ton of money. I think the biggest risks would be him cutting the benefits of SNAP, Medicare and medical benefits for kids and low income people. I believe that Trump is saying he is Christian because of the majority of the people in the US are Christian.  That way he will appeal to more people to get votes.\", \"I do not see Trump as a Christian, because of his actions with his tweets. [If you believe that Trump says he is a Christian because the majority of the people in the US are Christian, how does that make you feel? Does it bother you? I understand you do not see Trump as a Christian because of tweets, is it just his tweets you find unchristian or other forms of communication he has used?] I'm not happy about that myself.  However, he’s not pulling the wool over my eyes.  That is so fake.  Trump on his show was horrible to the non-celebrity people on it.  There's a way to say things and then there's a way to say things.  He wasn't kind to those people.\", \"How do I think I will be affected with a Trump presidency...Although he is not my ideal, I think my life will be affected positively from his victory? He will strengthen the military, and as a US Army vet I understand how and why this is so important. I think the economy will grow stronger under a leader who wants us to flourish rather than die (like the current resident in office) 2. The biggest benefits to a Trump presidency: a. Economy awakens b. Military strength c. control over our borders d. less authoritarian political correctness 3. The biggest risks of a Trump presidency: Other countries will see we have a strong leader b. He is temperamental, but FAR LESS temperamental than the queen of Hell herself named Clinton c. He will ruffle political feathers and shake things up 4. Donald Trump describes himself as a Christian. There are two types of Christians - Surface Christians and Deep Christians. He, of course, is a surface Christian. But so was I until 5 years ago, and even though my faith was somewhat weak, I do believe in God and tried to be a good person. That's about where he is, I think. Trump does not cometo the presidency after spending 20 years listening to an evil devil-inspired demon like Jeremiah wright who hates white people like Obama did. He is also more a Christian than the current resident in office, who was raised as a Muslim (this is detailed in his book, this is not me just bloviating).\", \"When and if Donald Trump wins (and I am hoping he does) I will feel safer knowing he is in charge of taking care of our country's security and wellbeing. He isn't afraid to fight back. We need someone in office that will stop giving away tons of money that this country could use for our own. We take better care of people in other country's than we do our all and he'll do away with that. The only risks that I can see is the GOP not uniting with him. A lot of government people don't like him because he's going to shake things up in Washington. Yes, I do believe Donald Trump is a Christian, he's a good husband, father, and business man. He wouldn't have gotten this far in life if he wasn't a man of God. [Hello again, I believe people are afraid of Trump shaking things up in Washington because of his language and behavior. What do you say to those individuals who believe Trump will shake things up, but are concerned of how he will do it?] I think that by the time he gets to Washington he will have the best advisors who will advise him to tone it down. I am hoping he shacks up Washington but I'd like to see it done right. I believe he knows he should and he has gotten better but he's not really good at it yet.\", \"I don't really like anything about it, but if I had to choose it would be the part about him giving very little to charities. I think that he would serve better promoting different charities than just giving and being yet another well-known name on their walls. [What about giving to charities do you like? If Trump gives to charities, is he not representing good Christian values by giving to others?] I like giving to charities because I am helping a worthy cause that means something to me. In some instances, that help is given through a monetary donation and in other instances I volunteer my time. I think we should think of helping charities with a mix of time, talent and treasure. If Mr. Trump gives to charities it is a start, but he is still missing giving of his time and talent.\", \"I know that Pope Francis had disagreed with Donald Trump on political policy making. I am a Catholic and I respect Pope Francis but I did not appreciate a religious leader interfering with his views on how to make policy within our nation.  I thought that the Pope needs to stay out of politics and stay governing the church where his speciality lies.  If a political leader asked for the Pope's advice then that is another side to the story; however, I think the Pope overstepped his authority.  On the other hand, I am interested to know more about charity contributions made by Donald Trump.   He does employ a number of workers and he has created opportunities for employment.  It would be nice to hear more about if he has contributed to worthy causes.  Perhaps he has but we are not aware of his works of mercy.\", 'I am a catholic but get so turned off by the way it always comes down to money for them. So what he doesn’t give to charity. Is it because he doesn’t give to them? [I understand your point that if Trump does not give to charity, it is because he does not give to charity. If Trump did give to charity, would that not demonstrate he has a priority to give to the needed and the less fortunate compared to not giving? How do you believe Trump should demonstrate his priorities?] I just don’t beleive that giving to a charity is a priority. Some people are generous and give and some people are not I don’t think people should be judged on that.', \"As a Catholic the lack of compassion is what stood out to me too. Although like I mentioned before it's hard to tell if this is really him or just a skit in order to get more media time and getting his bold suggestions across the country. And also he did donate a large sum of money to the veterans during one of his campaign stops which I believe was Iowa or Indiana, one of the I states.\", \"I totally agree with this statement so there isn't anything I don't like about it.  It speaks the truth.  What I don't like are the facts presented.  While Trump does donate to charity, a majority of it flows through his own Foundation.  Based on his wealth the amount he donates is minimal. Trump is not interested in really helping others unless it promotes his own agenda.  He supports groups or organizations if, and only if, it will benefit him in the long run.  For example, he will support groups on opposite ends of the spectrum if he thinks it will get him votes.\", 'What do they mean by different priorities?', \"I would like to see the whole picture.  How much has been investigated and researched into charity work or supported causes by Donald Trump.  Yes, the Catholic church supports a lot of service related activities, yet at the same time the Vatican, it's banks, real estate, artwork and other possessions amount to a great deal. Some of these investments if put to good use could help feed a 3rd world country.  I think that the Catholic Church and its hierarchy need to stay out of the facets of politics and take a closer look at not being so judgmental in their views against women's rights, gay marriage and birth control. etc. I take offense at this statement.  Recently our local archbishop made a statement about refusing divorced couples, gays and others the ability to receive communion at mass.  He basically was shunning certain groups of individuals.  This is real hypocrisy in the making.\", \"He seeks to enrich himself and become even more famous. He spends little time serving others and gives very little to charity. These statements stand out to be as this seems to be the core of Trump's personality. Mr. Trump has shown no proof at all as to what charities he supports or has given his time to. Mr. Trump has not shown his tax statement so he seems to be hiding how much he is or is not worth and what companies he does support. Mr. Trump is an actor at heart and you can tell that he loves to hear himself speak. At the debates he would hardly let anyone else talk by either interrupting them or shouting over them. He is rude when he talks to people and he if he becomes president only the rich will benefit as he has made it clear that he wants to cut taxes for the rich.\", 'I have found from experience that statements like this early have the whole picture taken into consideration when stated.  Add to this that many people try to incorrectly characterize others who don\\'t fit their specific mold of what a \"Christian\" should be.  I think Trump could be characterized in a similar fashion.  There is no denying his financial success; with a net worth of $4.5 billion, so say he has enriched himself would be an understatement.  As far as donating to charity, that is a slippery slope:  I conduct many charitable acts that go unpublished and unrecognized; this is how I want it to be.  I would imagine Trump does similar things, especially on the scale that he is able to operate at. (Male)', 'I find that this whole statement could be researched and found to be false.  I would be more inclined to believe that this statement was meant more to polarize public opinion than to guilt Trump into being more outward in his charitable activities.  I would want more facts to be presented before a statement like this would sway my opinion of the candidate. (Male)', \"I don't like anything about this, and I don't believe those statements are true. Donald Trump has and does donate plenty of money to charity's. I have read articles from families who are in need due to either health or job reasons and he has taken care of all of the expenses. I believe he is a very smart man and a lot of people are jealous of his success.\", \"I think this is a poor, misguided somewhat ignorant soul who should try to open their hearts and minds and not be so corrupted by the Clintons and Obamas' evil greed. I will not highlight anything because it's all pretty bland, untrue and originated by a low-information voter. I will pray that they will become more informed.\", \"I like that it talks about building bridges. In order to build bridges sometimes we need to build walls first to build bridges the proper way. [How would we need to build bridges the proper way? What does that entail and do you believe Trump is capable of building that way?] You need a strong foundation to support the weight of a bridge properly. There are times when the bridge can be at its maximum capacity and if the foundation isn't strong enough, it then collapses. Trump seems focused on building walls and I haven't determined yet if he is capable of somehow using those as a foundation for bridges. Perhaps Pope Francis will eventually have an impact on him.\", \"I don't like This is not the gospel. It seems like it doesn't fit in with talking about a politician. It is not relevant.\", \"I do agree that Trump is bullyish in quite a few of his comments but it's so hard to tell if he's making them for the cameras so they stay on him versus those are his actual opinions. I think right now it's all for attention as a child would who wants the lollipop. But in reality he has made quite a difference in his supporters and the Make America Great Again hats were a huge hit and made in the US so he actually was doing what he was professing and brought back a job to the US.\", 'He bullies opponents.... Just watch the exchange between he and M. Kelley. He deferred an answer and attacked her. He has no filter. I think that this statement is true. I agree that Trump bullies his opponents and speaks openly about gender and race in an offensive manner that is unbecoming to a leader of a country.  He should treat others with more respect and stand up for what he believes in through a more effective and civil manner.  He can be motivating, yet at the same time he needs to be more sensitive to what is deemed appropriate behavior.', 'I agree that Mr. Trump does bully people he feels are not as good as him.  He does not treat others as we want to be treated.  According to Christian doctrine he is certainly not following the rule.  Treating others respectfully should just be something everyone does, not just because of the golden rule.  He loves to make fun of people and that is a sure sign of someone we would not want to be around, let alone be President.', 'It’s true he does bully the opponents. But all elections in the past they bullied each other. He does take it to the extreme. He says what he wants. But should think a bit before he speaks', 'Not exactly fully correct. Read Matthew 22:34-40 Christ teaches us the Greatest Commandment: \"Love the L-rd your G-d with all our heart and soul and mind\" \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" All the Law and the prophets hang on these two commandments. To accuse Trump of \"not following the golden rule\" or bullying just sounds silly and petty. This is Politics, it\\'s dirty and grubby and absurd and disgusting and immoral. Besides, if someone is going to throw some accusations, then there should be facts to back it up.', '\" Mr. Trump does not follow the Golden Rule. He bullies opponents, women and minorities\" So true! I would hope that any person elected to represent this country at the very least could follow the golden rule!  In the few times I have watched him on tv I\\'ve noticed the bullying, and it\\'s the main thing that has put me off of him as a candidate.', \"I don't know what to make of this statement. I sort of need to know who is saying it and what their agenda is before I can judge it. Everyone has an agenda, sadly. Even the survey seems to have an agenda. It would be nice if these statements were labeled with the speaker.\", \"I least like that he stokes fear of the most vulnerable among us for his own political gain. He stokes fear because there is reason for fear. We have had mass shootings, bombings, etc. and nobody currently does anything to stop this. It is not for political gain. It is the truth. [I understand you believe Trump is speaking the truth when he says people need to fear, how do you think he is going to bring about subduing that fear when some people believe he purposely wants to make people fearful?] I don't know if he is capable of subduing the fear that he himself has stoked\", 'I believe that the pope needs to stay out of politics and administer to religion and church dealings. If he only knew how exclusionary his bishops have become in their own dioceses and how cover ups on banking and sexual molestation has impacted enrollment in parishes, schools and churches then he would be concentrating more on church issues rather than politics. Perhaps the pope needs to open the Vatican and house refugees instead of interfering in politics. I think that a private meeting with the Pope and Trump would have been productive.', 'Mr. Trump stokes fear I find it hard to believe that one person even Mr. Trump has the power to cause fear for much of anything even for political gain. I think people are tired of politician and their lies and not being able to get anything done that some people think Mr. Trump would be good for the country but as time goes on people will see him for what he is, a bigot with a lot of money. [Hello, why do you find it hard to believe that one person has the power to cause fear for so many?] I guess I have to retract that statement because look what Hitler was able to do for years and to thousands of people. I guess looking back through history a lot of dictators were able to harm or kill millions of people. Good thing the US is not a dictatorship and limits the power of the President because Trump might be able to pull off some of the things he wants to do like build a wall.', \"Refugees fleeing persecution should stay in their own part of the world where their views are more familiar and secure. Good for Trump for seeing that. Let's do follow God's teaching and fight against sharia law female mutilation, justified gang rapes, and slaughtering gays and Christians -- Actually these are among the people who are flooding the Clinton’s accounts with funding! Someone PLEASE tell this misguided person being quoted about the real horrors behind the evil liar presidential candidate.\", 'Again what I like least is that the writer has used Christian to get my attention, but doesn\\'t seem to be Christian and it just comes off awkward after reading and rereading. \"Mr. Trump stokes fear....\" This is just political rhetoric and or posturing. The whole idea of a political campaign is to affect people\\'s emotions, love, hate, fear, sympathy etc. If a candidate cannot find a way to affect and connect via emotional commentary, then why would anyone bother to listen? Again use of \"G-d\\'s teaching\" to get my attention as a Christian. I do not know if any of the accusations are 100% correct. I would like to see some facts or documentation after accusing Trump.', \"I don't really understand this author's complaint that Trump doesn't respect the God-given dignity of others because that's more of an opinion versus a truth. Trump is speaking on what he believes to be true which to others they don't believe in such as building a wall or abortion. He has a blunt way of proposing and talking about ideas however what he believes should change in the country is how he how he's explaining his dignity of others.\", \"Why is the pope casting such criticism?  If the pope were truly concerned and thought that he could make an impact upon a future leader, why not meet privately, and discuss concerns. I liken this situation to a circumstance that arose in my daughter's school.  A principal openly humiliated a student in front of the class to make a point. If the principal had truly been concerned about the welfare, mental state and dignity of the student then she would have privately discussed the matter. Instead the administrator made a public display so that the student was made an example of.  Is the pope not doing the same to Donald Trump?  Is he not putting Trump to shame? [Hello again. I understand you believe the Pope and Trump should be meet privately to discuss their differences, but why do you believe the Pope has made such statements? What were his objectives? Do you believe they have significance with Catholics or do many see the Pope putting Trump to shame?] I think both the Pope accomplished both in making his statements pertaining to Trump.  I believe that the Pope wants Catholics to vote for Trump perhaps now but maybe not in the beginning when there were many more candidates to choose from. I think he wanted to take a position, express his opinion and shame Trump.  If he didn't want to shame him publicly then the Pope would have met with him privately first. Unfortunately for the pope and many fellow Republicans, Trump became the presumptive nominee and won over other options that they would have preferred. I think that the Pope outwardly stated his opinion because he may upset with a Republican acting in such a manner. Even though there are Catholics that belong to either party, the church in no way supports the liberal views around gay marriage, transgender rights, prochoice, stem cell research, living together prior to marriage and birth control just to mention a few.  Nevertheless, I think the church advocates more the Republican views on these issues. But who in their intelligent mind would advocate how Trump treats and marginalizes groups of people.  I will have more to comment on tomorrow based upon the mass visit I made today and what I heard the priest stating regarding gospel lessons and today's politics but I believe that what the church teaching is terms of how we should be treating people and how we should be unifying not excluding is true. It's just that I think the church is segmented too.  Not everyone from the pope, to bishops to priests and to the congregation are speaking the same language and supplying the same accepting and unifying message unfortunately.\", 'What I like least is that It is, unfortunately, is that it is a pretty accurate description of the behavior of this presidential candidate.', \"I don't really find offense to knocking the crap out of someone throwing a tomato because we as a society have become very sarcastic in nature and if someone really did knock someone out I don't see a strong influence from Trump. The Pope said he would knock someone out too whoever talked about his mother wrongfully. So I like how Trump is not afraid to add in today's sarcasm to his political campaign.\", \"I really don't see anything as violent or hateful in his speech. This goes back to the fact that everyone will be offended by something and apparently whoever wrote these remarks doesn't recall any sarcastic things they've said before. I think it's brave and bold of Trump to talk like this on his campaign and whoever does act out on this has some mental issues themselves not to blame Trump. It's like the woman who sued McDonald’s because her coffee was too hot, ridiculous.\", '\"knock the crap out of someone who throws a tomato.\" How is this man a candidate for the Presidency?

Was this quote taken out of context Was there more to the story that meets the eye?  How could Trump get away with all of this without being reprimanded by the Republican National Party?  Why was he not rebuked by them?  Politics seems to be very dishonorable. [Hello, you ask some good questions. Why do you think Trump as not been reprimanded or rebuked by the Republican Party?] I think that they either afraid of him, know they can't control him or secretly support his methods. I lump all of them together (i.e. the Republican party) as a whole but do realize that they really are fractured into several groups working against or with each other. I do not think they as a party (nor the Democrats either) are solidified as a unified group.  Because of this segmentation, they can't seem to control Trump and are surprised to his rise and success among voters.\", 'I don\\'t think this is appropriate for a Presidential Candidate to tell people.

This goes back to my opinion that he is not a polished professional acting candidate. I think he speaks before he thinks and or knows what will get the crowed going.

Just shows how our country would be in trouble if he were elected', 'I am a catholic but don’t beleive in a lot of their statements because of their past actions.

The statements seem aimed at getting me to judge Donald Trump the candidate for President according to Christian values and beliefs when I don't really think he has professed to be a committed Christian. Now if it were Billy Graham or Robert Schuller or Joel Osteen, it would be a different story. If they exhibited the same methods and said the same things we hear from Trump on the campaign, then sure, throw the book at him. Also if you are going to use Christian phrases or references, know the original source and understand it clearly as well as the other scriptures that are related to it whether they be in old or New Testament and quote them chapter and verse. As for Judging Donald Trump, I would judge him as an international businessman and investor because THAT is where he DOES claim skill and experience.\", 'We need to know who says these things.  I guess I could Google this statement, so I will.  OK.  I cannot find who said it.  Who said it?

Whether or not you attended services, what would you like to hear from priests about how they are considering their faith in the upcoming presidential election?  Has your priest talked about the Presidential race in the past? Have they mentioned anything about the tone of the Presidential campaign? If so what have they talked about? Has it made an impact on how you think about the campaign?', 'The priest talked about the good Samaritan in his homily this weekend and posed the question, \"Who is our neighbor?\" Several people passed by the man in need, but not the good Samaritan, he showed mercy and helped and that\\'s what we should do as well.

In the past 3 Sunday\\'s the priest has not said anything regarding the Presidential race. As far as the tone of the Presidential campaign, there hasn\\'t been any mention of that either. What has made me think about the Presidential Campaign is the shootings of the Police Officers in Dallas. I don\\'t believe the Presidential candidates have spoken about the great divide in America between the police and blacks, who keep being shot by the police. It seems that the \"real\" problems or issues are being ignored by the Presidential candidates. This Presidential campaign has brought up issues that aren\\'t really issues, I feel in an attempt to take our minds off the real issues. Real issues, such as why are so many Police shooting unarmed blacks? Why are employers allowed to not pay overtime or benefits to employees by making them \"contract employees\" Why does Trump state he wants to bring back jobs to America, when his own daughter\\'s clothing line is made overseas.', 'I went to Church on Sunday. I listened carefully to what he said, but a lot of it had to do with Dallas, Minnesota and Louisiana. What I could relate to the election was that we must love each other as family. We are no different from another simply because of the color of our skin. We bleed and feel the same way. These things made me think about how Hilary seems to have empathy for everyone and not just those in her economic status. My Priest does not usually mention politics or any particular candidate. He focuses more on family, love and forgiveness.', \"I did attend my local Catholic church this Sunday hoping the priest would mention something in his homily and he did! I was shocked because I missed the last week and thought maybe something was mentioned then but I guess this election year really everyone is talking about it. He started with his homily talking about as Christians we are called to love our enemies and in the election what everyone is doing is condemning the character of each other more then their actions. I felt he was actually walking a thin line because at times in his homily it could be misconstrued that he was sounding like a Hillary sympathizer. He talked about how she was cleared of all charges brought against her and that people were angry at the judgement assuming the judgment was wrong. Well, in a lot of people's reality they do feel the judgement was wrong and corrupt. But the priest wanted to make a point that the judgement was accurate and people were still outraged attacking her character. For me personally I do think the judgement was corrupt a certain extent due to the fact she has a lot of strings she can pull her way in Washington. It didn't really change my opinion on the election. It did have an impact on me when he kept saying how as Christians we are supposed to love our enemy even if that means ISIS and to prayer not only for the souls of the persecuted but also the persecutor.\", 'I did attend mass this weekend, however the priest was more focused on the awful events that occurred over the past week and did not mention anything about the election/candidates. To my recollection he has never really spoken about politics in general. I would like to hear the priest urge parishioners to consider their options and weigh them through Catholic lenses. Reiterate what the church teaches (especially about marriage and abortion) and use that info to make a moral choice.', 'I was not able to go to services this Sunday which I was upset about. Our Priest is not very political at all and really he speaks of nothing about the campaign. Since I live outside of Orlando, FL our Priest spends a lot of time talking about the mass killing at the Pace night club and all the hate in the world. I would like to hear him talk about how the candidates need to talk more about family values and more tolerance needs to be done. I know our Priest does talk from time to time about the abortion issue and gay marriage which I have a hard time coming to grips with as I know it may be wrong but people should be able to make their own choices.', 'My priests do not talk directly about the presidential race or the candidates.  They talk about the issues and what our faith says about those issues.  They encourage us to make faith based decisions but do not name candidates or parties.  It is about voting for our beliefs more than for a person.  As such nothing about the tone has been mentioned.  I would not want my priest talking about the candidates or the election.  They are there for guidance in faith, not to take political stances.', \"I normally do not attend religious services regularly.  I did on Sunday just for this purpose.  Unfortunately, the priest never mentioned the presidential race.  The sermon was about the unrest and killings in this country at the present time.  To be honest I don't any religious leader should preach about who we should vote for.  I am sure they are for Donald Trump because of his position on Pro-life.  They are very closed minded and feel that all their congregation should feel the same.\", \"While not directly addressed in this week's sermon, the message was about finding and having hope in an uncertain future.  I can certainly see how that message could be translated to the current political environment we find ourselves in.  I am not generally a negative person, but the current state of affairs generally, and the political environment specifically, has caused a ripple in my thinking.  I am grateful for a spiritual advisor who can help me reframe my thinking and provide a historical and biblical context for times such as our happening in the past.  I am hopeful that whatever the outcome, that it will be for our good. [You are grateful when a spiritual advisor who can help you be reflective? Where do you draw the line for a spiritual advisor?] I always look forward to being able to interact with clergy of my church on a weekly basis.  It's easy to become mired in the day-to-day process of living life, and with all the negativity swirling around us, I have a real appreciation for the. 30,000-foot view of our world and the way we can go about living our lives.  As far as spiritual advising goes, outside of those positions within the church is where I draw the line.  It becomes very easy to confuse spiritual guidance with biased opinion, especially with those who may not have credentials or an ambiguous background. (Male)\", 'My pastor did not talk about the election but did talk about the country needing to come together to support and help those that are less fortunate and not judge individuals based on life circumstances but be filled with love and giving for all individuals. My pastor has not mentioned the election at all but has covered topics that seem to be associated such as personal attacks and trying to separate the country and create a divide. His talking about these aspects has made me realize exactly how much I will not vote for trump and that I will do anything in my power in order to make sure nobody I know will bode for him either by presenting information to them (Male)', 'This Sunday the pastor did not talk about anything I felt related to presidential election in a direct or clear way. In the past though I have heard topics discussed behind the pulpit in regards more to specific policies rather than the election or specific politicians. However, I have listened to a handful of panel discussions with Pastor\\'s I respect and admire, who in that setting, are far more willing to call out both candidates by name, and call out their different policies directly. As far as tone is concerned the closest statement I have heard to that came from John Piper who said something along the lines of \"We have one candidate in Clinton who wants to act like we don\\'t have a problem, and we have one in Trump who paints with a broad problem, and both are dangerous!\" Otherwise I have heard little specifically about the tone in the congregations I am involved with. (Male)', 'So, with the service I attended here in town, the pastor actually discussed The Golden Rule and combined that a little bit with the presidential election; he didn\\'t really get too deep or specific. He discussed both Trump and Clinton when speaking. I appreciate honesty from someone I trust, so I would welcome my pastor to discuss how faith plays a part in politics. However, some might not feel the same, so he has to walk this thin line. However, he and I have discussed faith in politics a few times before for a brief moment. My pastor has discussed the Presidential race before, but only briefly. He typically does not get too specific. It is normally more of a generic reference in stating the candidate\\'s name--not what he or she did or is doing. This is more or less how he has approached discussing the Presidential race. He talks about how important it is to have faith in politics. Without the Lord, we are not complete. He has made the statement in the past about how Trump appears non-Christian due to the name calling, but said it is not his call to question someone\\'s faith. It hasn\\'t really impacted my thoughts on the campaign. Of course, I take consideration into what my pastor says, but I form my own thoughts about issues. [Why would you welcome the discussion? Where do you believe the line should be drawn] I would welcome the discussion, because politics is one of those topics that is critically important to talk about superficially. I would draw the line where the pastor would bring his or her views and \"push\" them on others. (Male)', \"My pastor's sermon was focused on the teaching that we are called to be merciful to others as God has been merciful to us. I believe this quality of mercy is something that is important to me in deciding who I chose to vote for. Currently, I don't think many of the candidates have been merciful at all. My pastor has not talked about the Presidential race in the past. There has been no mention of the tone. [How would you feel if your pastor did talk about the race or anything that related to the race?] I would be a bit concerned. I think the pastor's main role is to proclaim the Scriptures. The Scriptures certainly apply to the election but I don't think they need to bring up the specific election issues. (Male)\", \"I wasn't able to attend, but my grandma visited my office this morning and I asked her what the sermon was about. She said it was about loving thy neighbor. I go to a very traditional church (wish we had something a bit more modern around) and they never really tie in current events with the sermons. However, I think this does apply to the situation involving cops shooting black people and then others retaliating. It doesn't have much to do with the election, but it does focus on loving everyone. My pastor doesn't talk about the election. He tends to keep politics out of his sermon (again, relating back to the fact that current events are hardly ever brought into the sermons.) I wish I had a better answer for you on this, but that's all I've got. [Hello, why do you believe current events are not brought up into the sermons? What is traditional about your church?] Everything is traditional. It's hard to explain. It's very old-school. We still sing the same old hymns our of a hymnal over and over again. We follow the same setup almost every week. Real life situations are never brought into the sermons so that's why current events are not discussed. It literally just focuses on scripture in the Bible...not how it applies to our lives or anything. I went to a Lutheran school until high school and that's really where I learned the most as far as adapting scripture into real life situations. My church just doesn't do that. I don't know their reasoning. (Female)\", 'It was interesting. This Sunday, the scriptures were about honesty. This actually led to the discussion of the presidential race. We see Trump as being honest because he is out in the open, but Hilary can keep a secret. Being able to keep a secret is not a good thing when it comes to running for president. We, the people, would not know what is going on in our own nation. I think that it made me feel really good knowing that my pastor was behind me on who I favor for the presidential election. The actual tone was not mentioned, but only because we moved topics rather quick before anything got heated. (Female)', 'I was unable to attend church this weekend. I was on duty here at the fire station. I honestly prefer when the pastor does not try to directly tell the church who to vote for. I prefer that they teach the bible. If I am a faithful follower, then I should be able to discern the best candidate for me. Our pastor has mentioned the race and his belief that it is an important one. He spoke about how important it was that we should all vote, but has never mentioned either candidates name. His only instruction is to vote for our convictions. (Male)', 'Our pastor has yet to discuss the Presidential election, but has done so in the past, saying that both parties need to reach a middle ground of compromise, so as to bring unity to the election process. He also feels that the entire tone is an unfriendly one, not in keeping with the spirit of brotherhood that MLK and other faith leaders have mentioned in similar eras. I happen to agree with him that people need to speak more compassionately and work for a sense of brotherhood. (Male)', \"The pastor did not say much that was relevant to the Presidential election this past Sunday. It's pretty rare that the subject of politics comes up during the sermons at my church. I can recall, however, that at some point around the time that it became clear who the candidates would be, the pastor commented on the uncertainty surrounding the election. His point was not to be distraught by circumstances like this, which I would say is an implication that the state of the election is a negative one. This didn't really have much of an impact on how I thought about the election, because I already agreed with him. (Male)\", \"I went to church Saturday night. (My church holds services on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings). It was a regular service with worship an a sermon. We were going over a passage from 1 Corinthians. The pastor didn't bring up anything about the presidential election. My church avoids taking sides publicly in such discussions. The passage was about love, so I guess that could be applied to the election season though in terms of all questions about candidates not being civil. But I would never draw that political connection automatically while sitting in a church service. I would not like to hear much about how pastors are considering their faith in the presidential election, not unless they speak in general terms and don't indicate party affiliation. Talking about faith in terms of moral issues is perfectly admissible. Indicating party affiliation while doing so, which is what most pastors have a proclivity to do, is inexcusable. It can alienate people who we want to welcome with loving arms.\", \"My pastor has talked about the presidential race, but not in sermons. Three months ago, our church held a multi-church event hosted by pastors from 5 local churches to talk about politics, faith and political philosophy (Plato), which my organization took part in hosting. All were agreed, although all came from conservative backgrounds, that not indicating party affiliation or candidate affiliation was the only appropriate way to have such a discussion. But there is no discussion of political races on Sunday mornings. My pastor hasn't mentioned anything about the tone of the race since he doesn't really go into that. I don't think anything he had to say about it would change my opinions. He's a close friend of the family, and we're probably on the same page anyway. (Female)\", 'I did attend religious services (Christian Reformed Church) and the pastor didn\\'t say anything that I felt particularly spoke to the upcoming presidential election. It was edifying in my spiritual walk though, and he did affirm and encourage our church despite the \"scary\" news topics and tragedies that have been occurring. This is a new church for me and I am not familiar with him ever speaking on the Presidential race. In fact, I don\\'t have any memories of a pastor preaching on any election. So, I would have to answer no, they haven\\'t mentioned anything about the tone of the Presidential campaign. [Hello, I am unclear about the following portion of your comment, could you please clarify?  \"It was edifying in my spiritual walk though, and he did affirm and encourage our church despite the \"scary\" news topics and tragedies that have been occurring.\"  Also, you state you do not have any recollection of pastors preaching on any presidential election. What is your preference if they do or not?] The pastor\\'s topic of preaching and encouraging his congregation was not to ignore the tragedies that have been happening (the shootings in Orlando and Dallas for instance) but instead was to proclaim that though evil happens the world still belongs to God.   My preference is that a pastor does not preach on the presidential election. No one in authority should persuade voters or be in a position to potentially persuade so as not to open the door to corruption. (Female)', 'Our pastor has talked in some capacity but the election. Mostly just focusing on principles about how to be a good citizen in the country and that voting is important. They have not mentioned much about specific candidates. They have specifically said that the tone of the election is hostile. I agree. (Female)', 'I was unable to attend a service this weekend, due to work, but I have had a service that was centered around the election and its tone. My pastor was deeply concerned with the state the countries well-being if it had come down to Trump or Hillary, which we now know it has been decided. Just like what I believe the rest of the congregation felt, no one wanted those candidates. The pastor made note of the different races and different financial standings that have come together for God and worship in our church, and that there should be any walls or boundaries for all human kind. He then asked us if we elected one of these candidates to think about how different the United States will be. Will other religions be persecuted, will races be discouraged and beaten down, and will the financially unable be turned away at a time of need? This did shape the way I view the candidates to a certain degree, it made me think about their character and if they can morally and physically be beneficial to this country. (Female)', \"We were told last week that we would have a time of prayer at each service over what has been going on in the country racially. As soon as our pastor got on stage, he said that political parties won't solve our problems. Only prayer will help. He invited police officers on stage and he and an African American man prayed over them and our country. Our pastor prayed for the things that divide us to unite us. He prayed that we would be Jesus with skin on and show kindness. That goes for politics as well. We need to come together as one nation. In the past, I can't remember our main pastor or any of the other staff who have spoken to bring up the election. There are a few local politicians who go to our church, and our pastor has talked about them and had them stand up before. (The mayor and a man who is now a state representative are examples.) [Hi Sarah, do you remember in what context these politicians were talked about? How do you see this kind of interaction? Appropriate or not?] The mayor is very involved in the community events we do, so he is well known by our staff. The state representative was in our pastor's group when he was a youth pastor. They have known each other for over 20 years. Our pastor has never told us to go vote for them but he acknowledges that they go to our church, so I think it is ok.\", 'Our pastor has not said a lot specifically about the presidential race, but he has said a lot about the direction our country is headed in the way of politics. Yesterday in the sermon he did briefly recap the current events of the week, beginning with the 4th of July and the reason we celebrate was because of religion. The first settlers came to America because of religion and they felt religion in Europe was going the wrong direction. He went on to talk about Trump suing a hat company for making hats not fully made in the US, and then talked about the news of Clinton was careless with her email but had not done anything worth criminal charges. From there he moved on into his topic of the sermon.', \"I did manage to go to church and the sermon was on how to remain faithful to God. Part of remaining faithful to God is to rely on his kingdom to fix all the problems that we're facing. I don't believe that any of the problems we face can actually be fixed by a human ruler. I certainly don't believe that God is involved in the election. I don't think he favors one over the other. I believe that Jesus made it clear that his kingdom was no part of this world. In any case the sermon had nothing to do with the election and I was not influenced when where the other on how to vote. If I could hear anything from pastors about the political process, I guess I would like to hear they're genuine personal opinion. I want to know how they feel as human beings and not paid political shills because I do feel that there is some agenda behind their words at this point. I am sure that they did not appear on this commercial free of charge, now did they? I don't even know who any of those people are so I have no reason to believe them. But anyway I would encourage everyone to speak frankly and express their opinions honestly and that's what I'm interested in listening to no matter who is speaking. And that is what is so crazy and ironic here can't you see? That's what I like about Trump.  he says what he thinks. He doesn't worry about what other people are going to think or the political costs. He's not calculated and scripted. Anyway I have spoken frankly myself throughout this study and I believe that you get the idea of where I'm coming from. Do you have any questions I'll be more than happy to explain my position further?\", 'Our pastor did not mention anything particularly political in nature at all with regards to American culture. This is likely due in part to his awareness of the separation of church and state as well as the fact that his family is Slovak and he is generally asking for prayers for them and others who are affected by what Russia is doing. I wish that our pastor WOULD talk about the race as I am really in a quandary as to who to vote for and it would help to have a theological take on both candidates separately. As for other things, he DID reference the recent killing of police officers in Dallas Texas and that made me think that more security for political events and rallies might be a good idea.', \"And that we need a president who understands need for more bulletproof vests and helmets for ALL our public safety staff ACCROSS the USA. He did mention that we should be praying for the gunman and the police officers in Dallas he killed (at the Black Lives Matter rally). He only referenced it and did not make any specific remarks about it, just that it was a terrible tragedy. Father Val more often than not just asks us to pray for these events. He may have personal beliefs about presidential candidates, but I have never heard him express any of his view.  He has not mentioned the presidential race or its tone at all.  for this reason, there has been no effect on my thoughts or beliefs about the campaign from church a way. But I know after church at the social hour people talk. [I understand you wish for your pastor to talk about the race, how would you want him to do this? What do you feel is appropriate or not?] I think it's appropriate to speak about what characteristics we should look out for or want to see in a candidate without specifying names euphemisms tic references to actual candidates or political parties. I mean sometimes it's helpful to hear the values of a third party. And it doesn't have to be a list of polarizing views but it's good to hear what spiritual leaders are putting out there as standards for us to seek in our candidates. I don't feel it is appropriate for pastor to say who they are voting for or tell us a specific candidate is good or bad.\", \"This Sunday I did attend a service that I haven't been in a very long time. The pastor was talking about the trouble that has been going on this past week. It is a very scary time in the USA. My heart is heavy with all the hate in this world. He spoke on how we need to forgive the shooter and the killing of those two black men. He also spoke on how if Mr. Trump had his way this would become our new normal. That's scares me to death. He also said that we need to be prepared for the worst. Mr. Trump has so much to learn about compassion, and about forgiveness and for us to pray for him.\", \"Our pastor did not say anything in this sermon regarding the presidential race, he spoke mainly about building family and the shootings of the past week. He has mentioned the race in the past and has done a sermon series about servant leadership. The congregation prayed for our future leaders. I don't know if I would want to hear my pastor's views on politics, at least not from the pulpit. That seems to run the risk of being judgmental. He has not said anything about the tone.\", \"My pastor had not talked about the candidates specifically, but he has mentioned the tone of the campaign. Mostly joking about how difficult it is to find someone worth voting for. It hadn't impacted my thoughts about the campaign.\", 'I attended a service yesterday, and no mention of the presidential race. Why? Because politics should never be mentioned in church. We don\\'t go to \"politic house\" to worship politicians on Sundays, we go to church to worship God.

Just sayin.', \"When I went to Mass yesterday almost all of the service was about the tragedy that happened in Dallas. Not much was said about the presidential race, it kind of took a back seat to Dallas. It wouldn't matter to me if my Priest said anything bad about Donald Trump because my mind is made up and he is who I'm voting for. I would never vote for Hillary Clinton after what the FBI said about her. [Hello, what specifically about the FBI turns you completely away from Clinton? I understand that it would not matter to you if the Priest discussed the election, but what is your position if you did not know who you were voting for?] the FBI investigated her actions with the emails and ruled they weren't going to indicate. her. this made me mad. if she is that careless with top secret information I believe she would be careless as president. plus, she is going to owe a lot of people favors and it's going to be Obama all over again. she should of been held responsible for her actions. I still believe in Donald Trump; he is the best of the two running.\", \"During our church service, the pastor was preaching from I Timothy, God's good goal for the church, chapter 6. He did not say anything specificity about the election. What I would like to hear is what he's already said - that it's more important to not get into fights with people over these issues. He has not said anything specifically about the issues or the candidates of the election. He has made general references to the tone of the election indicating how sad it is that things have degenerated to the level that they have. What he said only confirmed what I was already thinking.\", \"My pastor has not talked specifically about the Presidential races, but a couple of months ago, he did speak about the plight of the immigrants, the ones Donald Trump has spoken about turning away.  In a roundabout way, I believe that was his way of pointing out the flaws in Trump's beliefs without endorsing one candidate. There has not, however, been any discussion or sermon about the upcoming election. We did attend services this past weekend. The sermon did not tie in with the election or the candidates' tone. As far as what I would like to hear from our pastors and how their faith guides them, I think it would be nice for them to tie in Biblical passages with the candidate’s viewpoint on some issues. I mentioned earlier about welcoming Muslim immigrants into our country but as a church, we've heard about the views on gay marriage and Planned Parenthood. I believe those are important issues to be addressed and to have scriptures to confirm our beliefs as they relate to each candidate (and what they represent) would be helpful in these conflicted times.\", \"The minister has not talked about the presidential campaign or past or present. [Hello, why do you think your minister has not talked about presidential elections, past or present? Do you prefer this or not?] My pastor says to pray for the nation and that we need to pray for the upcoming election.  I guess in that way he talks about the election. I agree with him that we need to pray for our nation. FYI I live in Philly but all of my family lives in Colorado, (where I'm from originally).  Therefore, we don't attend the same church but I will be going to Colorado next week so I'm going to talk to my family about the election.  I usually try to avoid politics because we don't usually see things the same way.\", 'Is this purely a Hate-Trump forum? Why so many \"when did you stop beating your wife\" questions to corner me into hating Trump? Both of these candidates are horribly flawed.

Thanks.', 'My only thoughts on this are that several of these verses are often taken out of context. I personally would not think of any of these verses when deciding on who to vote for. The one verse I do think of when voting is Romans 13:1 which says no one is in authority except those appointed by God. This leads me to pray about who I should vote for. [Why would you not think of these verses when deciding who to vote for? How are they taken out of context?] To fully understand a verse, it is important to understand what context it is in. I can\\'t see the verses now, and I don\\'t remember all of them, but for example the one on mercy, is right in the middle of the Beatitudes, which is actually a small piece of the sermon on the mount. (3 chapters long). There was one from Proverbs, which is usually ok to take just one verse and apply it since a lot of the book is simply short proverbs to live by. Another one was the Golden Rule which is also a part of the sermon on the Mount but a couple chapters after the Beatitudes. Why not use the entire sermon on the mount to judge how Trump is doing as a person? But, in the same sermon on the mount we are told not to judge others. Therefore, none of the verses given would be something I would consider when voting for a president. I would love to have a Christian president in office, but I\\'m not sure when the last time was that we had a Christian president. Probably not in my lifetime, although most claim to be Christians just as Trump does. Clinton claimed to be a Christian, but yet had an affair while in the Whitehouse. If a candidate claims to be a Christian, the first thing I will look for is if his or her lifestyle honors God. If it does not, then I know it is just another \"American Christian\" and I look at other things when deciding who to vote for. Remembering that no matter what, whoever gets into office gets there as part of God\\'s sovereign plan.', 'ke in our last session, please imagine you are at lunch with a friend who is a person of faith who gives you the following reasons to vote against Donald Trump. Please rank the top three statements that concern you the most about Donald Trump and discuss the reasons you choose those statements. Also, tell us what you would say in response to your friend about the ones you choose and any that do not concern you.', '\"I choose this statement: Donald Trump wants to be President, the face of America and a role model to our children, but he routinely calls people names, brags and lashes out in anger. We are constantly telling our children to set good examples, and never to bully or tolerate being bullied.  Here we are faced with a presidential candidate that does nothing but bully and speak poorly to and about people. I can tell you exactly what I\\'d say to a friend because this conversation has taken place on many occasions.  I say, whether or not you like, voted, or support President Obama, he is a man of character.  He is the face of our nation and he is a good role model.  He acts in a \"\"presidential manner\"\" that is nothing but respectful and compassionate.  He is a family man, he treats his wife and daughter\\'s with respect.  He does not bully people or slander them in the public eye.  He carries himself in a poised, controlled manner. \"', '\"First off, all these statements concern me about Trump. Number 1 Donald Trump wants to be President, the face of America and a role model to our children, but he routinely calls people names, brags and lashes out in anger.... I think this one is a biggie because I believe the President needs to be level-headed. He is not. He always feels ready to attack. He is always on guard. Sometimes you need to sit and reflect on situations. He doesn\\'t seem very capable of doing that. Plus, I think he would have a hard time listening to advice from advisers.', 'I think the first statement pretty well says it all.  He has continuously made fun of people.  He has no tolerance for anyone different from him.  Everyone else is wrong.  Our country is already in turmoil and by him spewing all this hate is only making it worse.  He is a role model for no one.  I cannot understand how intelligent people think he is Presidential material.', \"Donald Trump wants to be President, the face of America and a role model to our children, but he routinely calls people names, brags and lashes out in anger. This is my second concern about Trump because a prideful person has a lot of secrets and insecurities that would make me hesitant in thinking of their capabilities to run a country. It makes him appear egotistical and narcissistic to where only his ideas and concerns matter. I'm not saying to be a role model you have to reach everyone on a positive level because not everyone will be tuned in to that idea but you have to at least be positive to a majority of viewers. If your whole demeanor is coming off abrasive, then you are losing that majority of people who want you to lead them.\", '\"I chose this point because I feel it is important to be the example not the problem, especially when you are trying to take on a position of power such as this. Trump portrays himself in such a poor light.  He is not so much of a Christian man as ever when he displays such behavior. He is not setting a good example for our future generations. He is basically telling them it is ok to act like this. That it is ok to disrespect women, and make fun of people with disabilities, and have affairs. He is a terrible role model\"', \"Donald Trump seems to be an intelligent man. He wouldn't have made it this far in the business world if he wasn't intelligent. He must know that calling people names, mocking people, and brags in a negative way. He must know that these behaviors would impact his presidential campaign negatively, but he just won't control himself. This is scary. It tells me that he reacts emotionally without thinking, and that sort of behavior will be devastating for a nation let by somebody like that with that sort of power. This is exactly what I would tell a friend. I'm not bashful about speaking my mind about this to a true friend. (Female)\", \"Again this does not concern or bother me. Again I find it refreshing to find someone who is not concerned what the PC police are going to say. Everyone else is scripted and researched and everything is carefully calibrated to be pandering and it's boring and we can see right through it. Is Trump offensive? Yep. He is. But so what. I don't think that a president who is polite is going to necessarily get anything done.\", \"It's true I don't like his attitude towards other people and his anger. He will have to learn patience and statesmanship. But I trust him far more then Clinton. She has been caught lying so much and people seem to keep letting her get by with it.\", '\"I am a teacher and I regularly teach my students to be positive about others.  \"\"Bullies don\\'t fare well in the school yard, eventually they get beat up. How do you think Trump is going to fare with his verbal bullying tactics in the international school yard? I really don\\'t want to find out!\"\"\"', 'I picked this one because, again, it has the same idea as the others. Our choice in this election is voting for the pathological liar who has corruption and scandal follow her wherever she goes.', '\"This is the second most concerning statement: Donald Trump wants to be President, but doesn’t show respect for women. He has routinely criticized women for their appearances and weight, and made crude sexual comments. We need a President who respects others, doesn’t treat them with disrespect. This ties into exactly what I said for the first most concerning statement.  Trump does not act in a \"\"presidential manner\"“.  NO ONE should stand for someone calling them names and making fun of them.  This is not who we as Americans should look to run our nation.  this is the exact conversation I have with friends when discussing Trumps behavior.\"', '\"This is again an awful way for a presidential candidate to behave. He needs to keep his opinions to himself and be more respectful. Hiw can we respect him \"', \"Considering about half of voters are female, he needs to start considering them in a higher esteem that a body that's there to look pretty and available for the menfolk. Good grief, what decade is this man living in? When he's president, he won't be hiring any females for positions of power and decision-making. (Female)\", \"With abortion and pro-choice vs pro-life and the fight between militant feminism and pro-woman movements we need a president who is on the side of women everywhere. The president needs to make the safety of women and the sanctity of life a priority, and Trump won't do that if he is so careless with his words and attitudes towards women. (Female)\", '\"I just feel this is an important reason to single out. I can\\'t disagree with you! What is going to happen, if elected President, when he has to work with a woman in a leadership position in another country? International relationships could go sour. On top of that, making fun or comments toward anyone is just wrong.\" (Male)', 'In response, I would have to Agree, the choice in this election is the bully vs the criminal.  The best thing I can say about her is that Scandal and corruption seem to follow her wherever she goes. \"', '\"I am a woman. I have daughters whom I am striving to raise to be confident, responsible, and self-aware human beings. I refuse to elect a man who demeans and degrades women.  \"\"So you would be ok if Trump was speaking to your daughter and told her she was fat, needed to go on a diet, and oh, was not as capable as a man in the world of business?\"\"\"', 'I selected this one mainly because of the disrespect. Trump has shown disrespect to women and also people with disabilities and pretty much anyone different than him. I do not want our leader to make it acceptable to tear others down for our own personal gain. It makes him look little and petty. But if we allow someone to become president who behaves this way, it starts to normalize it. That would be terrible.', \"Women make up roughly half of the population.  We deserve respect and an equal opportunity to voice our opinion.  This behavior shows outright disrespect for us. He doesn't value our opinion unless we are being the obedient cheerleader. If he is trying to put us down and silence us now, what will happen if and when he ends up in office?\", '\"2) Donald Trump says he is a Christian, but he has not behaved that way in his personal life. He is on his third marriage and ended his first marriage because he was having an affair with his second wife. Here is an excellent example, of someone who professes to have Christian values, but then he behaves in a manner that is totally against Christian values. This concerns me, that someone like this would be elected. A man who cheats on his wife and family, not just once, is a person who has no honor, and no business being President.', \"I really don't think his personal life should have a great bearing on his competence to run the country.  I'm sure most of the previous presidents have quite a few skeletons in their closets.  With Trump it’s just that we know most of them.  Christianity means not hurting others and treating everyone with respect.  He does not do that but I don't think it has anything to do with his previous marriages or cheating.  Let's just focus on the important issues.\", '\"I’m not sure how Mr. Trump can call himself a Christian with a straight face for the way he has lived his life that is why I picked this as # 3.  If you want to tell a person what a non-Christian lifestyle is you can point them to Mr. Trump. Aside from multiple marriages he has been accused of lying about his investment school and cheating people out of their money, he had lied about business deals plus he is not at all honest about his net worth. Mr. Trump shows to compassion towards others plus he has no respect for anyone from the way he cusses and degrades people.\"', '\"I chose this statement as I was the most shocked by Mr. Trumps words and actions when it came to the disabled reporter.  Can you believe that someone would act that way towards a disabled person? I don\\'t understand how he made it through the primaries with the way he acts. Mr. Trump has no compassion towards people that are not like him. Mr. Trump acts like a 10-year-old school yard bully.\"', '\"Again this is just another reason. He needs to clean up his act. What are we teaching our children if we allow a president to behave like this”?', '\"Number 2 - Donald Trump has mocked a disabled reporter for his disability. We need someone in the White House who respects the dignity of people like the disabled, not someone that insults them.... This should be a very simple thing for him to understand. He is just set on being a bully. What kind of a person over the age of maybe 12, makes fun of someone because they have a disability? I know so many children who would not even do this. Trump has little common sense.', \"It is appalling to see a leader and representative demean the sanctity of human life.  I was unaware that he had acted in such a repulsive manner until I saw a television ad against him. I find it deplorable that he had the nerve to behave such a way and in public for all to see and witness.  He should have apologized if he hadn't and work towards uplifting the human spirit rather than tearing it down.  As an example, Michael Vick, a famous football quarterback was sent to prison for endorsing dog fighting and animal abuse. As part of his social justice and community service program he focused on volunteering and donating funds to help animal rights activism.  Donald Trump should be focusing on the same for disabled people by donating time, effort, money, etc. to uphold their cause and dignity in order to make up for his senseless behavior and insulting antics.\", '\"Third: Donald Trump has mocked a disabled reporter for his disability. We need someone in the White House who respects the dignity of people like the disabled, not someone that insults them. I choose this because, I have a child with special needs and this is appalling that a person, let alone a presidential candidate would make fun of someone.   Along the same lines as my previous answers, this is awful.  What kind of role model, nation\\'s leader would say such a horrible thing?  He is not a role model that I want my children or myself to have to look up to.  anyone who can disrespect so many people just because they are different should not be in charge of the country. The USA is very diverse, but Trump seems to only be concerned about certain people. plus, he should be able to respectfully deal with all kinds of people', \"That was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen an official do.  Even if I ever was thinking of voting for him that would have stopped me.  He is such an egomaniac.  People he doesn't like and has made fun of, such as disabled people, women, immigrants would all probably lose any progress that we have made.  Programs would be cut and there would certainly be more homeless people because of no benefits.\", \"This survey unfairly presupposes that any of these comments actually bother me. In fact, they really don't. But I know you want comments on this so I will try to do my best and give you something to work with. I'll tell you why it doesn't bother me. I am tired of people who are afraid to say anything because they will be criticized for being not politically correct. Even if something is offensive. It is refreshing to see someone who will say what's on his mind and does not care what other people think. As I have said many times during the course of this study, I am not looking for moral leader and a president. It doesn't concern me. All I want is president who can help the economy because we're broke. If people wanted to elect someone who was a Christian, then the primary system would have produced a Christian candidate. But it did not. So there you go. The people have spoken!\", \"This is another hot topic that most people find concerning. Donald Trump didn't so much as call for a ban as he did wanting to put a stall on things until the government could put together a better screening process. I don't see anything wrong with this, but a ton of people do. I definitely think there should be a better screening process all around. (Female)\", \"I have two reasons Trump's perspective on this bothers me. First, what better way to evangelize to Islamic people than if they are coming right to our backyard! Secondly, I believe this is seriously overstepping the bounds of the government, and creates a slippery slope for Trump and the presidents to follow if they decide they don't like a different group. This is a dangerous stance for anyone in power to take. (Male)\", '\"I really REALLY hope I get to do a bunch of Hillary ignorant features to equal this out. Just sayin. I would tell my friend to avoid cutting off his nose to spite his face and vote for Trump to avoid the Queen of Lies (Clinton). None of the above statements matters. I selected one to appease your rules. Regarding the one I selected - Yes, keep the Muslims out. We can love them better by providing them with a new place to live in THEIR OWN REGION OF THE WORLD. We\\'re a rich nation, right? Build them some houses! Teach the people to fish instead of feeding them.  I don\\'t like Trump. But I despise being lied to, ahem, by the Queen of Liars.\"', '\"Unable to mark the statements, only one statement can be marked. Thus, I will copy the statement and then add my comments. 1)Donald Trump wants to be President, but doesn’t show respect for women. He has routinely criticized women for their appearances and weight, and made crude sexual comments. We need a President who respects others, doesn’t treat them with disrespect. Donald Trump\\'s actions, regarding lack of respect for others is a big concern for me. How can a leader of free world behave like this? I used to think he was kidding, but more and more he shows that he does not respect anyone. This is the most critical statement in my opinion. Donald Trump does not live up to American values, let alone Christian values. He does not support religious freedom, which was a founding ideal of America.\"', 'This statement concerns me the most because I am fearful of banning anyone based on religious reasons. That is so close to persecution, and that can be turned on Christians too. On the other hand, I will still be very very tempted to go with Trump since I absolutely will not vote for Hillary, and I do want SOME sort of controls on the border. (Female)', '\"I hate that this country is being led to fear outsiders and that some people want nothing to do with hurting and abused people. All these people want to do is be safe and work hard, just like the rest of us. They should not be penalized for that. I want us to continue to allow people to come here and feel accepted. I really feel that Trump is using people\\'s fear to gain votes and that is not right.\"', 'The least concerning statement to me is about him getting remarried after an affair during his first marriage. I am already aware that he is not a Christian nor a good man. However, many men have messed up at some point in their lives. While this is not ok, it is not a main concern of mine when it comes to his ability to run a country. Quite frankly many politicians seem to philander.', 'Donald Trump says he is a Christian, but he has not behaved that way in his personal life. He is on his third marriage and ended his first marriage because he was having an affair with his second wife. The only statement that I feel like doesn’t concern me is the one about his personal life.  It’s really none of my business that he’s been married three times or that he cheated on his wife.  Is it reprehensible?  Yes, but it isn’t a factor in whether I would vote for him or not.  No.', \"Donald Trump says he is a Christian, but he has not behaved that way in his personal life. He is on his third marriage and ended his first marriage because he was having an affair with his second wife. I don't like this statement, primarily because of bringing Christianity into it, but it doesn't concern me. I don't care how many marriages the man has had. I would not like it if he had an affair in office, but everyone in DC has had affairs. We don't have much of a selection of good candidates these days. (Female)\", '\"Donald Trump says he is a Christian, but he has not behaved that way in his personal life. He is on his third marriage and ended his first marriage because he was having an affair with his second wife.\" This statement does concern me, because yes he uses women like their toys and when the new one comes out he trades the old one in. The fact of divorce on the other hand has become so common in the United States that it is seemed at normal. Now I am not condoning divorce, but I do understand the reasoning behind it. Trump on the other hand has no reasoning behind his actions, only the fact that he liked the new shiny Barbie. Though his marriage record and his personal life, has no place in the campaign for his presidency. \" (Female)', \"I'm going to comment on the comments he makes about women. I believe Trump is a feminist. I don't think he has any problem with women. I think he loves women. I also think that his wife and his daughter will help him to shape policies that will be beneficial and effective for women. As for the name calling comma again I find it refreshing to hear someone who does not Candor, and who is not scripted. Well some of his comments May offend others, I feel that they are refreshing and truthful nature outweighs the negative aspect. As for the immigrants. Well. I don't have the answers to that. I don't know what should be done with all these immigrants. All I know is that my middle-class existence has disappeared and I'm very concerned about that. I need to take care of my family here, and worry about them, not a bunch of immigrants who are not even my religion. I don't understand why we are expected to fix everybody's problems. Can we just fix America's problems first and then deal with letting all kinds of people in?  The bottom line is that this does not affect me directly and therefore I don't care.\", \"Trump clearly has his frailties as any other person in the public eye, his marriage record, his inability to censor himself at times and say things that are not so politically correct with regards to women or the disabled press person, but honestly, sometimes he just says what everyone else is thinking but not willing to say out loud. Basically, I feel like Trump is pretty transparent and what we see is what we get. I kind of like that. Whereas Hillary, has a different persona. I see Hillary as a politician who has made secret deals behind closed doors, she will say and do whatever she has to get elected. I expect that there were payoffs in the past, cover ups when people mysteriously died or (killed themselves or had accidents) and payoffs and cover ups regarding her failure to use proper protocols regarding classified emails and then there was her blatant lying about events she supposedly experienced while in the Middle East when she was not a party to those events. She's just slimy.\", \"1 - Hillary has a mouth worse than a sailor, they just hide it for her. 2 - Women interviewed who worked for Trump all say wonderful things about him. 3 - Mocking a disabled person? Really? You are grasping at straws. I am the mother of a 36-year-old disabled person and I am not offended. 4 - Donald Trump does not live up to American values? Is his long-time-personal aide the offspring of renowned Muslim Brotherhood people (weiners wife)? That's just a starting statement. Don't want to waste too much effort cuz you are a brick wall anyway.\", \"I feel it says things I have already heard. I listen to the Pope's speeches whenever possible. I have great respect for Him. He makes a lot of sense and I value what he has to say. This video shows a very big difference between what the Pope says and what Trump says. It is like two opposites. I think this video is enlightening to who Trump really is.\", \"I've heard all of the references highlighted in the video and while I agree with Pope Francis I believe the non-Catholic world will not view it well.  I can already hear the references of the Pope trying to sway our election.  The other thing that would concern me is that candidates other than Trump would use these clips to their benefit.  I hold our Pope in high esteem and would hate to see that happen.\", 'It seems very contrived to make Trump seem even worse than he is. [Hi, what made you believe the video made Trump seem even worse than he is?] Dying get me wrong, I feel that Trump is terrible. But this video specifically took quotes of his and pitted then against the Pope. You could do this just as successfully with any candidate or any person. Context and making are needed to understand what was being said and why.', 'I think the pope is the kind of person the world needs more of, but unfortunately there are more people like Trump. The pope wants to break down walls that separate people and Trump wants to build walls to keep them out.', \"It led me warmer to Trump just because of how overly edited it was on both Trump and the Pope's statements. This was definitely a gorilla style ad to scare the weak and I hope with how much the media is flooded with scare tactics that people will look further online for the full statements and truth.\", 'Much cooler.  I never saw that speech where he says you have to be wealthy in order to be great.  That is really scary for someone to think like that.  If he becomes President I feel sorry for all us middle class and poor people.  Next he will build a wall around us.  It is pretty evident when he mentions the wall he is referring to Mexicans; He always picks on the people least able to defend themselves.', 'Colder if that is possible towards Trump with his statement about having to be wealthy to be great. Trump is such a snob as he just degraded all the teachers, poets, labors and every American with a statement like that. What has Trump ever done that is great other then decimate the land with buildings?', 'I am disappointed at times in the statements and behavior of Trump.  I do not believe that he should make outrageous statements as those shown in the video regarding mistakes and wealth.  Nevertheless, the video is one sided depicting Trump at his worst.  The Pope is a respected religious leader that needs to examine the issues that I presented and stop shaming a political candidate and stick to religious matters.', 'I guess my only confusion is why is this video necessary.  The media has widely publicized this information so why combine all of these particular clips.  I almost feel like this will be used against the Trump campaign and thus using our beloved Pope as a tool in this election.  I\\'m not sure I agree with that. [What role/tool do you see the Pope playing in the election? How should he go about changing peoples\\' opinions?] Hi Nikki - I don\\'t believe he should play a role in the election.  Nor do I believe Joel Osteen or T.D. Jakes should.  When political leaders become actively involved in elections I believe it can divide churches/congregations.  I have family members who are strong Trump supporters as well as some adamant Clinton supporters.  All of them are Catholic.  The non-Trump supporters use what the Pope has said to support their Hillary agenda.  This type of thinking can divide the Church if anyone feels like they must follow the Pope\\'s lead on who to support in an election.    Are you asking how he should go about changing peoples\\' opinion on a particular candidate?  I don\\'t think he should.  He should just speak the truth and not make comments like \"then he is not a Christian\".  If he had left that one comments out I would have been okay with everything else.  If you are asking generally how he can change peoples\\' opinion on civility, mercy, and loving one’s neighbor as themselves, then he should keep promoting civility, acceptance, and love in general.  He should teach them by showing them just as he has been doing.  He is not living an extravagant lifestyle as other Popes have.  He is one of us and is very open to say so.  Actions like this make us embrace him as well as others of different religions.  I have even had acquaintances who are atheist say they like what he has to say.  Maybe by the Pope being humble and accepting it allows those who are not believers to embrace his teaching and ultimately becoming believers.', \"I question why the Pope is being used in political campaign advertisements. I really take offense when a religious leader such as the respected and learned Pope Francis interferes with the political system.  Is there not separation of church and state?  Do we not take religion out of public schools? Are we not allowed to pray in public schools or mention religion without including all other religions?  I feel that if the Pope is trying to sway my opinion he is doing it in the wrong manner. [Hello. I understand you believe the Pope is going about changing your opinion in the wrong manner. What role do you see the Pope playing in the election? How should he go about changing peoples' opinions?] I think that the Pope has a right to speak about change, issues and the Church's values; however, I think that if he is going to speak about it he must also be a proponent of the change.  He should lay out a plan to make that change.  I think in the case of Donald Trump he needs to state that he would like to work with him on devising a way to treat people more fairly.  Perhaps he could suggest some sort of joint initiative from the Trump camp and the Vatican to perform an act of mercy.  Trump ran a fundraiser for Veterans, why not get together with the Pope and have them match $ for $ towards feeding the hungry in the US or holding a benefit for another underprivileged group that needs assistance and deem this as taking care of your neighbor. I think it would wise to have Trump meet with religious leaders and display good character.  We are used to Donald Trump displaying inappropriate behavior, yet in no way do I approve of it. I felt that the Pope displayed inappropriate behavior without follow up on how to turn Donald Trump around.  Trump is a viable force to be reckoned with not dismissed.  If anyone could propose change in a feasible manner it could be the Pope because he is so well liked and respected.  Have him use that charisma and insight to fine tune Donald Trump so that he could be an appropriate solution for failing America?\", \"I think his multiple marriages should be brought up. [Why do you believe Trump's multiple marriages should have been brought up] Well his first marriage collapsed because he was unfaithful with Marla. His first wife and Marla had a very public argument on the slopes of Aspen, when his wife discovered he had brought his Mistress along on a family Christmas vacation.   I just feel that if people knew that he does not hold his family and wedding vows as sacred, that would show what type of person he is.   He has declared bankruptcy as many times as he has been married.\", \"Yes! The full statements of both people. And how about the Pope's apology that he shouldn't have made the statement in the first part or Trump's remarks back to the Pope. [The suggestions you made, how would they change the video and your feelings about it?] I feel if the video wasn't chopped up and recorded with the responses it wouldn't have such a one sided message. The video's message would change and display a more realistic approach of both people and not so much of a scare tactic. If both parties could be accurately portrayed, I think it would leave the audience with less tension and confusion from the original video showed. However, in today's society, media outlets thrive off that scare tactic behavior to scare rather then inform the public so I don't ever see how a video or message would be displayed accurately.\", \"Yes, there was something missing, objectivity. I did not see the statements that the Pope made later on taking back his statements about Donald Trump.  I believe that Pope reissued a statement after there was outcry from many stating that the Pope needs to stay out of the politics of the United States.  Perhaps he can concentrate on the politics of keeping fraud out of the Vatican banking system. As I have stated before, if the Pope cared about turning Trump around then he should have met with him in a private manner and had an advisory session with him. [How would the reissued statement made by the Pope change your opinion and feelings about the video? Why is this statement important?] I would have seen a different side of the Pope, him admitting that he needed to adjust his statement. I think that this would have made the video seem not as slanted towards one side.  I think that I would not have been so critical of the Pope if this had been displayed. I also would have liked to have seen Trump's responses to both dialogues by the Pope. I think the statement made by the Pope clarifies to the public that there is a bigger picture that needs to be examined. This is sensationalism and there is always more to the story than meets the eye.\", \"More context to all the statements. [Hi Rebecca. What context do you believe was missing?] It gives 3 second clips of whatever goes against what the Pope was saying. I have no idea what he was saying those things in reference to or even if this was a poorly chosen moment of sarcasm. The video takes what it wants and gives us nothing else. These sorts of things are scary with how Easy it is for them to mislead people into thinking whatever the producer wanted them to even if it's the opposite of true. I happen to believe this particular one does represent Trump accurately but the format bothers me.\", 'Everything important was left out and this just saddens me to know America\\'s media is being funded on misinformation and chopped up broadcasting because it\\'s the scare tactics that feed into the insecurities of our citizens. Another perfect example is Orsen Welles radio broadcast of \"War of the Worlds\" where actual foolish people committed suicide because of the broadcast. I\\'m thankful to live in a technology based day where social media is the driving force of getting truth spread.', 'I wished that the Pope had stated that he wanted to arrange a meeting with Trump to discuss how the 2 could work together to iron out plans of compromise.  I wish that the Pope who started the conversation had stated that he wanted to work with Trump on building bridges via politics instead of tearing him down. Yes, Trump could have turned around and asked for a meeting too to work on a plan to settle these areas; however, I do not think that a religious leader putting a candidate on the spot is appropriate.', \"I thought that this video was overtly preachy and it stung. well I myself do not care for all of Donald Trump's policies, I found this video and nothing more than your average political smear campaign; mudslinging. As human beings, let alone Christians and other believers, it is not our place to judge Mr. Trump. No one's got a perfect existence, and bigotry isn't a crime, merely bothersome to certain populace.

To some I'm sure that would be the opinion I think if we had a crew of cameras and videos and were allowed access as a fly on the wall of Hillary’s house or hotel or conference rooms or the backseat of her limos.... I imagine we would see an interesting side of Hillary, but with Trump, what you see is what you get. I've never heard Trump profess to be a born again Christian so I don't think we can hold him to Christian values.\", 'I agree with the verse \"that all have fallen short of the glory of God\" and agree that all need to repent. This video is uncomfortable to watch and makes me wish even more that Ted Cruz could have been the nominee.

But, I also know I cannot sit out the election especially in a swing state and allow Hillary Clinton to become President.', 'I didn\\'t like their approach. I hated the way one of the pastors said \"his prayer\" was that Donald Trump would repent. I\\'m sure that\\'s everyone\\'s prayer if the man is not a Christian, but it\\'s so self-righteous to say that in an interview. I think they were right to object to the behaviors they did, that much was valuable. But I didn\\'t like the way the first two went about it. It came off arrogant. The third one, the one talking about immigration, wasn\\'t as bad in terms of being arrogant, but I don\\'t agree that we have a moral responsibility toward any other religious group. We have a moral obligation toward them as humans made in the image of God, not because they are part of another faith. (Female)', \"I found them to be sincere.  I especially found most sincere the pastor who said he would not have said anything if Trump had not identified himself as a Christian. But I do find all of this quite misplaced. This man is the chosen person. There were lots of different Republican people running for office and he beat every one of those people. I'm sorry you don't like him but the people have spoken. This should have this should have all taken place during the primaries. The primaries are over.\", 'I think the pastors were responding to video clips out of context and I may agree with some of what they said, particularly about the need for us to pray for Trump to repent and become a Christian. I feel if they were shown various clips of Hillary saying or doing certain things, she could be made to look equally bad if not more so.', \"I respect their opinion but don't' think they know Donald Trump well enough to think he's not a Christian. None of their views change my mind. We do need to screen other's coming into this country better. I was living up in Boston during the bombing of the marathon. Those 2 brothers took advantage of our country with housing, food, schooling and what not and then turned on us. You can be to safe these days. [What makes you believe they do not know Trump well enough? What do you want them to know? How could the message about Muslim be communicated better? What would you want to hear?] they only spoke of the negative things about Donald Trump and not of any of the positive things he has done. I would want them to know about his family life, his children and their accomplishments. the children wouldn't be who they are today if Donald Trump didn't raise them right. if he was so bad they would have turned out bad. he had a good childhood and made sure his children did too. he even has grandchildren that he is helping to grow into responsible adults. the Muslim's have to realize when they come to our country they should abide by our rules, if we go to their country we're not allowed to drink and have to dress like them on top of it all. we shouldn't have to change for them, if they want to come here they need to change.\", \"Cooler. I didn't know he doesn't believe he never does anything wrong. Honestly I wish more than anything we had other choices for President!!!\", \"I feel the same. I'm not so weak-minded as to let a 2-minute commercial change the way I feel about something. Also I have not considered the source yet.

Always.\", 'A little cooler, I\\'ve tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, because he is inexperienced as a politician.  But it\\'s very telling when he says he doesn\\'t need to repent, because he hasn\\'t made any mistakes.

I will do my absolute best to represent it and help to make it a better place for the next generation\"', 'It made me feel cooler because it is all his faults shown in sequentially and it is discouraging to think this is the best we have got.  But, I still trust him vastly more than Clinton and it is not enough by any stretch of the imagination to make me change my voting plan. [What I meant was those times when you have opinions or impressions swirling around in your head concerning something you saw or heard .... What I was referring to for me anyway was when I heard the pastors speak on the video it kinda gave voice to those fragment an of thoughts I had on the subject ... Therefore, it validated my feelings and put it in a cohesive coherent statement] I will not change because I do not trust Clinton and cannot think of a single policy of hers I would support.  Also, I know if she is elected she will appoint very liberal judges and Supreme Court Justices and this is not consistent with my faith.  I have never been overly enthused by Trump and this video was just a reminder of why I have not gotten excited about his candidacy.', \"There was nothing much confusing about the video other than who the affiliation was. Was it at the end? [Who do you think is affiliated with the video and why? How does this change your opinion about the video?] Faith in Public Life I believe due to the emblem being at the emblem--I must have missed it! No, it doesn't change my opinion of the video at all. It's calling out a candidate from the party it traditionally is synonymous with (Republican) and showing his flaws. (Male)\", 'There was nothing confusing about this video, it seemed like your average, every day, generic, religion-funded political campaign. (Male)', 'Not really confusing, aside from the fact that, to the best of my recollection, there has never been such an outspoken and blunt candidate for president.', \"I would like to have seen the opinions of more pastors to see if a broader sampling would have generated the same negative tone that this advertisement did. [If the sampling was negative or positive, how would a broader sampling impacted your feelings about the video?] It's hard to say really. My big concern would be that the only religious people who may come out and support Trump would be people at polarizing as he is, which would have as detrimental an effect as he does to himself. That's the worst part of that sort of thing: since people can speak freely about their choice of candidate, they can do as much bad as good. Politics is so polarizing, yet so important.

What would you have wanted included?] Oh there isn't anything in particular I wanted or need to see that wasn't included. I just know from keeping up with the election there are scores of other sound bites from both Trump and other evangelical leaders that could have been applied well here. I always love more visual and audible evidence, but I understand the video was probably intended to be fairly short.   (Male)\", \"No. Right now as I am on this page I cannot watch it again. I will watch it again if I am given the opportunity and I will pay attention this time to who put this out. I'm interested in knowing who's behind it and what the agenda is. I very much sincerely doubt that this video is put together by since your Christians. I'm sure that it's some political hack and who knows maybe Hillary Clinton is behind it. Maybe one of the Koch brothers. All I know is that everybody's got an agenda and no one is innocent and no one is really good.\", \"Maybe more of each interview and debate.  I try not to form an opinion of a candidate based on a couple of soundbites.  Maybe more about where he stood on other issues besides Muslims immigrating. [What other issues would you have liked to see covered? How much more of the interview and debate should be included to feel that there was nothing missing?] Issues like healthcare, the economy, taxes, education, the environment, foreign policy, etc., As for the clips, just a little more of each interview, so it didn't feel so pieced together.\", \"I would have liked to seen a bit more about all of the issues in the video.  Healthcare, economy, security, where he stands on gun control.  As shocking as his statements of faith are, there will be so much more called into question if he wins the presidency. [How would you have wanted these issues covered in the video? How would your feelings about the video changed if they had been included?]  I'm sure there is footage out there somewhere of Trump mentioning at least some of these issues.  Even if they stream some of his tweets during the video it would be something.  I'm not sure that my feelings would change very much, just that I would feel better forming an opinion on more than just a couple examples.\", 'One of the 10 commandments is \" thou shall not bear false witness. [Hello. What would need to be done to make the video show the complete conversation?] Well It would be difficult because the actual real time conversations would take up too much time for average commercial, but I was particularly concerned about the quotes from various Christian ministers which I question what else was said in conversation. When the quotes are only one sided about one candidate.... I mean did those same candidates actually fully support Hillary? Or were their reasonable responses regarding Trump just part of a much bigger interview.  It just reminds me of how many times people will quote the Bible as saying \" Money is the root of all evil.\" When they leave out \"The LOVE of\" that actually precedes the quote and REALLY changes its whole meaning.  So I just wonder what was said in the whole interview. Maybe you could show the whole interview as a printed newspaper column and just highlight or embolden the part of the quotes that are being said and, et the viewer judge for themselves.  I thought I explained in my last line of response. I will try again.

[I think it is interesting that you say the video is a kind way to inform voters and drive a point home. How is the video kind? How would have a not kind video looked?] It felt kind in that it didn\\'t make the voter feel stupid for not knowing those things, and in that it didn\\'t \"attack,\" Trump. It didn\\'t portray him in the best light, but it didn\\'t take things out of context to make him look bad either.

Some will tell me to pray on my decision but I also know that I need logic, instinct and a full examination of who can live up to the standards that I attest to when it comes to values and rights that I feel are important for my family and community. I cannot just pray for a sign.  I can listen to the sermons and homilies at mass and have them inspire me to reflect on what I know to be proper and appropriate ways to behave.  However, at the same time I have to look at the hypocrisy of 'man' representing a religion that preaches to treat people one way yet makes its own mistakes in treating people the way I feel Christ would have if he been here with us now. These days my faith is conflicted yet I will persist to work through these internal conflicts as I have in the past, because we are truly human and can make mistakes.

He should never have made comments on Trump's statement about building a wall because it has nothing to do with blocking out potential new citizens and everything on protecting the ones we have. It's about keeping illegals from taking advantage of opportunities from our citizens and having access to a country's benefits without the individual having to make the sacrifice of leaving their country to claim the US as their own. While there are thousands of people from countries not bordering the US who are on a waiting list to become a US citizen and here are Mexicans and other nationalities jumping or borders taking the spots of those hard earned immigrants who have an ocean and fees blocking their way.\"]\n",

What should happen is churches and private citizens should support international organizations that can help these people. Trump should call on people to do that instead of focusing on banning a group of religious people. I would still side with Trump for at least wanting to get immigration under control in some form.

He also has mocked disabled people and insulted them. He seems to not respect Muslim refugees and wants to ban them from entering the United States.

I think this statement does not take into the account the complexities of a very complicated issue. Yes, we are to have compassion on the weak, and do everything we can for them. But if we don't put an end to illegal immigration, the country will be weakened. Our cultural values are the basis of our liberty. Not all refugees want a democratic system, nor have the education to know how to preserve it even if they do want one. They need time to assimilate. Otherwise, we'd be overrun and not have our own country. And not having that country, a country with a free market system, etc... could reduce us to such a level of poverty that we wouldn't be able to help the poor the way we could in prosperity.

So romanticizing them in order to make a candidate look bad does nothing.  The irony is that if we look the other way, and allow them all in with no restrictions, and a terrorist slipped in or crime rates increased we\\'d all be blaming the president for letting them all in.

I want to see compassion for those who are hurting. I want to see more racial equality instead of division. We are all people who deserve a fair chance. In my opinion, a moral leader is one who will work with both sides and come up with solutions that will help and unite. We need to stay one nation.\", 'Right now I think it is a mudslinging.

This is a perfect example of government trying to interfere with the private sector and misusing its ability as a government. This country was founded on division of church and state and now the US is trying to limit those churches religious liberties by attacking business owners and trying to find loop holes to overstep its power. Laws need to be established to protect citizens to private owned businesses liberties and not suffocate under a government rule.\", \"I explained all of my stand in the other question.  I really can't support any of these as they stand.  I don't feel that religious freedom is under attack in the US.  I do feel that personal civil liberties are under attack.  So if the wording were to be changed then the last item would be my 2nd issue.  I think freedom of religion, personal health, personal identification, personal protection is under attack. I believe amendment rights need to be upheld but that assault rifles/weapons should not be openly sold while background checks are so lax.\", 'Tough list here, but I do believe that religious freedom is under attack in the US. Wanting to increase surveillance/or disallow immigrants who are Muslim is an attack on religious freedom.', 'Religious freedom is no longer being protected. Laws are being passed that force people to do things against their religion. For example, with all the Obamacare stuff that passed, employers are being forced to pay for contraceptives even though certain religions find contraceptives morally wrong.', 'I am a very religious person and I would hate to be under attack for such things.

They were looking for religious freedom and an opportunity to begin a better life.  Many had been persecuted for their religious beliefs and were not willing to abandon those principles so starting a new life in a new land was an attractive option.  Trump’s unmerciful stance on refugee and immigrants goes against every aspect of the principles our country was founded upon.  I don’t believe we should just open the floodgate for immigrants and refugees to come to America without proper documentation and screening.  However, to say they can’t flee a war torn country to look for a better life because of religion is wrong.  Again, there must be proper documentation and screening because we live in a different world than we did when our country was established.', 'The attitude a behavior of trump goes against everything we are as a country the constant hate he spreads needs you be shut down before this hate filled closed minded xenophobic bigot destroys this country all 9f his actions a statements are concerning and every time he opens his mouth i wish he would just shut it we do not want our country or religion represented by this type of person this will create a rift not just among our country but against our allies as well (Male)', 'Donald Trump seeks to stop illegal immigration and to prevent attacks from occurring in the United States based on a religious context.  He has said nothing about immigration generally, or legal immigration practices, and has said nothing about those who either practice non-violent religion or are fleeing religious persecution. (Male)', 'I chose this one as the most important because that was what America was founded on, the land of the free. Some of the states were founded by people coming over from other countries because they were being persecuted for their religion. Even though I am a woman and do believe that we should not be sexualized and degraded by Trump, this one is bigger than that, this one is about what America is! (Female)', \"This nation was emigrated to by foreigners, and they stole it from the native populace. By preventing another century of immigrants, we're being hypocritical. (Male)\", \"I do not believe his viewpoints on immigrants. It's lacking in compassion which is one of the key foundations of being a Christian. I also think it paints immigrants and refugees as people who are trying to take advantage of all America has to offer without taking into consideration the value of them as contributing members of society and as people themselves escaping dire living conditions.\", \"I understand why this concerns you but our current President also does not always support Christian people who are fleeing their country and what to live in our country to have religious freedom.  The Rome like family came here legally from Germany because it is against the law to homeschool your children in Germany.  They could not accept the secular education their children would be exposed to in Germany.  The Obama administration fought to have them deported where if the Romeikes did not send their children to public school, then they would have been removed from their Christian biological parents' home.  I understand why you think we should open our country to refugees and I especially agree with you that we should accept Christian refugees fleeing prosecution.  Trump is not against this.  He is in support of slowing down the acceptance of refugees from areas of known Islamic terrorists who are not Christians until we have in place a better means to vet them before we allow them in.  This is to protect America and our way of life.\", 'He speaks out against Muslims coming into US because of the terrorist attacks we keep experiencing are at the hands of Islamic extremists. I agree on this issue.', '\"Donald Trump attacks the least among us, such as undocumented immigrants who struggle to make a living and raise their families. Trump attacks them for political gain, threatening to deport them and tear apart Christian families where some young children are citizens but their parents are not.\"', \"I would say that I don't like that Trump attacks them and immigrant should be able to come to the United States, but I do think immigrants should be documented and should be willing to do what is necessary to become legal residents.\", 'Donald Trump does not have Christian values as he claims. He lashes out in anger, calls people names and is not a good role model for our country or our children. He does not respect woman, and has made very crude remarks in public, that have been sexual in nature, as well as criticizing women for their appearance and weight. He also has mocked disabled people and insulted them. He seems to not respect Muslim refugees and wants to ban them from entering the United States. He also wants to deport undocumented immigrants, who have young children that are citizens. Donald Trump is pretty much against whatever America stands for.', 'I’m not concerned the immigrants. We live in a world of diverse backgrounds. I don’t think that impacts my decision on voting for him or not', \"All the statements about immigrants and refugees don't bother me at all because I understand what he's trying to say in his messages. I receive those statements and concerns in a positive manner. I see Trump as a man trying to protect his country first before being able to outreach his support and concerns to other countries. I think he's absolutely correct in his statements that we need to protect our own citizens including our Mexican Syrian citizens because they are the ones with the rights to be here not the undocumented. I'm married to a Mexican man and his entire Mexican family have the same beliefs. Their families came here legally and learned the language from TV shows and schooling that why shouldn't other people. Which is what Trump is trying to get across. If we all went about coming in to this country the legal and right way, there is no issue. We are simply trying to protect our citizens before we can outreach a hand to other countries. There are plenty of private funded organizations that work towards protecting and helping citizens and other impoverished people, I just don't believe our government should be involved in helping them first before our citizens because our country needs a lot of help itself before we can go around helping others with them assuming we are doing fine on the inside. Especially since our education system in particular is so destructive.\", 'Although I would never be deported or forcefully separated from my family I can’t even begin to imagine what sort of emotional pain that would cause. Separating mothers from their children because they are illegal immigrants is terrible. They came here seeking a better life for their families and he wants to take that away? My heart hurts at the very thought', 'I am not proud of the other items in the list. There are many people that have broken their marriage vows so I will not be a judge of his private life.  In fact, I believe that divorced couples should be welcomed back into the church without having to go through an expensive annulment that is required only for money making purposes. Although I feel compassion and sympathy for immigrants and refugees, I think there should be quantitative limits on both. Illegal immigrants impact our economy/crime/employment/health benefits, etc. negatively in a number of ways. At times I wonder why some of our citizens are in such hopeless and dire circumstances as compared to the immigrant population.  As for refugees, it should be a requirement and responsibility for other nations to also share the burden of taking in refugees too.  Other countries need to step up and allow refugees to enter their country for sanctuary too.  I think that Trump has valid concerns over the safety and security of our country.  Yes, we should help those in need but we also need to protect the rights and safety of our own citizens first before allowing others to enter our country when we are not sure of their intent, terrorist associations or origin.  I think the way that Trump has handled these situations has not always been in the most appropriate manner; however, he has tapped into an area that is of much concern to many people.', 'All of these statements concern me with regards to the state of our country this type of hate will destroy this country (Male)', 'When it says that Trump attack immigrants that are undocumented, that is not true. I mean he is going by the law if you think about it. I mean, yes, he wants to deport, but they should have gotten themselves documented when they got to the Us so that they were not breaking the law. (Female)', 'The statement about the \"undocumented immigrants\" does not concern me because they are illegal aliens. If those same people came here on a visa, then I would have no problem with it. But they are not. They broke the law coming here and there should be some sort of consequence. (Male)', 'All of these concern me. I think that his negative comments regarding women and the disabled are closely related to his comments on immigrants, refugees, and political opponents. It shows that he has little respect for those he dislikes. (Male)', 'Concerning disabled individuals, refugees, Muslims, and immigrants, Trump is not showing generosity or kindness. How can we trust him to choose wisely and with discretion for this country when he has such an intolerance to the less than perfect person? (Female)', \"He attacks all Muslims.

These refugees are fleeing persecution, and Christ taught us to help those in need.  We need to help but not at the risk of our safety.', 'I would have to say the statement that least concerns me is the statement that refer to \" trump does not live up to ordinal American values...\" In think the pint stresses in throw statement is an over reach and the countryman also founded on the principal of fee market American Dream capitalism and he has embodied that over his lifetime. I don’t believe he is persecuting people exclusivity because of their religious beliefs with regards to entering the united states ... He does however have other immigration bias', 'The statement about the disabled reporter is probably the least concerning, although they all concern me to a point. We do need to treat the disabled with respect and dignity but I feel there are a lot more people in this country claiming disabled that find some little thing to claim disability and they take advantage of the system. This is not to put down those who are truly disabled, but often the disabled do more to support themselves in society than many who claim disability.', \"I'm less concerned by Trumps comments about Muslims, since I think this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  However, I think Clinton won't be happy until we're all speaking Arabic and following Sharia law\", \"The Pope's comments were also edited tremendously. Of course the Pope speaks on compassion and forgiveness. We are taught to love the sinner but hate the sin. He should never have made comments on Trump's statement about building a wall because it has nothing to do with blocking out potential new citizens and everything on protecting the ones we have. It's about keeping illegals from taking advantage of opportunities from our citizens and having access to a country's benefits without the individual having to make the sacrifice of leaving their country to claim the US as their own. While there are thousands of people from countries not bordering the US who are on a waiting list to become a US citizen and here are Mexicans and other nationalities jumping or borders taking the spots of those hard earned immigrants who have an ocean and fees blocking their way.\", 'He makes valid points in the video. People of all faiths and even no faith relate to him and what he says.  The most important thing he says is that we should be building bridges not walls.  In my mind those bridges should include a process for immigrants to come into the US but by legal means.', \"I think that that Pope speaks the truth yet The Vatican has a wall built around it. When the Pope visited Philadelphia where I reside, a huge fence and walled structure was erected to keep the area secure. There were so many people that missed the Mass on the Parkway because they were held up in security lines because they couldn't get past the guarded fences. The wealth of the Vatican is so large that third world countries could be continuously fed if the grandeur and splendor of wealth would be sold and turned into revenue to fund poor villages with food.\", \"They all have legitimate claims against him. I agree with most of them. The only one I don't is about Muslims. My stance is based on fear and maybe not right but I just don't believe God would expect us to sit down and allow ourselves to be killed off.

Keep up the failed attempts to brainwash tho. Maybe somebody will buy it. Not me.\", \"Especially regarding the temporary Muslim ban, important context was missing. [What context is missing do you believe? How would this impact your feelings towards the video?]  It's typical politics.

There are many people who believe in God and say they are Christian. He admits to only going to church on the big holidays but even a lukewarm Christian is still a Christian. I cannot judge his personal relationship with God, only his actions. He does not portray Christians in a very good light right now with some of his hate speech. Hate is not what we are about!

Does this candidate have the ability to be merciful and loving? Do they show compassion? Or do they boast and put down others? It has made a good impact on me.

Since the study did not ask specifically about personality, how has your changed over time?] We study through the Bible about God's love/sacrifice, prophecy, and commandments.

It was a very challenging sermon since I live in an area of the country and attend a church that is predominantly white like me.  It was also good because he gave suggestions on how we can raise our children to not view the world in terms of race.  Our pastor did not speak directly on how this relates to the upcoming election or in regards to any candidates but it did make me personally think about how the candidates would or would not be able to bring unity back to our country. Our pastors do briefly mention the Presidential race at times but it is more in passing than giving us specific advice or information in regards to the candidates.  They tend to focus more on how we live in a broken world and no politician alone can change that.  Instead, our country needs revival and more of a return to following and sharing God's Word.  They believe that much of the turmoil in society is an opportunity for us to share the Gospel with those individuals and our pastors challenge us not to be discouraged by these times of uncertainty in our country but to firmly anchor our hope and faith in Jesus Christ.

We must have in place the means to protect our country and our citizens even if it includes a temporary ban on accepting Muslims until we can appropriately screen to the best of our ability their intentions upon entering our country. [What in your opinion is the best way to communicate that we need to reach to Muslims, but still protect the country? How should this be done that would be favored by those who have the same beliefs as yours?] Our church is actively involved in sending missionaries to Muslim countries and this practice needs to continue.  We also reach out to the Muslims who are here in the United States by befriending them, getting to know them, and understanding their culture but letting them know almost immediately we believe in Jesus. I think we protect the country by a thorough screening process before allowing any Muslim enter the country and more consistent enforcement of the immigration policies we have in regard to overstayed VISAs and green cards.  I am not saying we never allow Muslims in our country again but I do think we have to accept that the vast majority of terrorist attacks are perpetrated by Muslims.  Once the President sees a plan in place to adequately and thoroughly screen then we can begin the process of allowing Muslims to enter our country\", \"I respect Max Lucado and I agree with what he said---if Trump didn't call himself a Christian, his behavior would not be something that we could hold him accountable for.\", \"The one that stood out was the one who said his prayer for Trump is that he would repent of his sins and come to Christ.

I always just voted democrat at every election except this year. I am so sick of a government who doesn't care about the people.

I am honestly waiting until everything is final and we are down to the front runners.  With social media it's hard to pick out the truth from everyone's perception, so I figure I will research more closely when it gets closer to the time to vote.\", 'Very Closely is how I have been following this year’s presidential election. I care greatly that a slimy liar like Hillary Clinton is NOT elected. I am an army vet who was stationed in Bangkok during the fall of Saigon and I CANNOT imagine how I would have felt had my country abandoned me the way Clinton turned her back on the requests for security and help from our people in Benghazi. Her campaign funds come from the same people who are terrorists and trying to kill us. She is evil. I don\\'t like Trump either, but he did not turn his back on his country and take “donations\" from all sorts of terrorist organizations.', 'I follow the election process each time, but this year has been terrible. I have always been a fan of Mike Huckabee, but he is too conservative to win. Our country has become so divided and the insults hurled from both sides have been brutal. I have never been a fan of Obama, but I was raised to respect whoever was put in charge of our country.', \"I am definitely not a fan of Trump and cannot believe he is going to be the Republican nominee. I had started to hear more about Kasich and become a fan of his, but by then it was too late. The media had made it all about Trump and we weren't hearing much about the other candidates.\", \"[How are you following closely? What are you looking at and what are you looking for?] I followed the election a lot closer earlier in the year before the primary in my state. Now that there are 2 presumptive nominees, I haven't been following it as closely.\", \"I follow politics even during non-presidential election years and feel it is important to be informed.  I consider myself a conservative first then a Republican.  I listen to a lot of conservative talk radio and watched at least 75% of the Republican primary debates.  I feel it is important to be informed so I could make the decision I felt was best when voting in the primaries. I haven't been following it a ton. I'm not a fan of either of the two leading candidates and as they each emerged as the forerunner of their respective political parties my interest waned. Our town did host both of them, so that was exciting even if you don't support them, it's nice to see them locally.\", \"I normally don't follow the election at all.  But this year I'm kind of not really following it.

This means helping the minorities, the lower classes, the children who cannot yet vote, the people who cannot afford to help pay for your campaigns, and even the people who voted against you.  America cannot survive if just one type of person is catered to.  Be those the rich people, the majority, the politicians, the oil companies, or the executives.  None of these people, by themselves, can help America survive.  Can you HONESTLY say that you are working for all Americans despite any differences in class, color, religion, or opinion?  If not, then you are not fit to serve as the leader of ALL of America.', \"Dear Candidate, my vote will be determined by how honest I feel you are. Please remember you are to become our leader and we need to rely on you. No offense to the 3rd party guy because he doesn't stand a chance so I'll just focus on Donald and Hillary. Hillary, you are a legit criminal and I have no clue how you are still not behind bars. Your pockets run deep with favors and monies owed and it'll interesting to see how you pay those off because I'm still boggled as to how you got so far. Speaking as a woman you definitely aren't getting the fem power from me. You wouldn't be able to ever get my vote because I don't think you could ever have a clear conscience. Donald, you are a very blunt man. But you've done your research or at least paid someone to do it because you know exactly how to create such a powerful image or both positivity and negativity but you do it all on your own dime which is great, thanks for that. You have a lot of extreme ideas that provoke a lot in people. I love to discuss the immigration one because I actually grew up in a border town close to the AZ/Mexican border and I do have to admit it's scary as a youth running into an illegal in the desert, especially when you don't know any Spanish. I'd love to give you some firsthand insight of that if you're interested. I'd like to let you know that you scare me as well. You do a lot of bold and run around talking and lack compassion, at least I've never seen any on any regard. Even though you are a forceful man, you've been supporting yourself on your own dime and I do enjoy your political incorrectness and putting politicians in their place so you will definitely get my vote versus Hillary.\", 'I would ask Mr. Trump that since I have not made up my mind on who to vote for could he please give me a concrete plan on what he plans on doing with the over spending of the government such as welfare and the military. I would want to know what his plans are for Obama Care and the environment. I would ask Ms. Clinton what she also plans on doing with Obama Care and the environment.

I expect that you focus on earning my vote by appealing to the values I stand for.

I also want to know how you are going to begin reducing our national debt.', \"Dear Candidates, I'm having a hard time trying to find the right person to choose for president.  It's okay to have a difference of opinion, because that's what differentiates the parties.  But it's a hard pill to swallow when you are given to candidates that genuinely seem to hate each other.  I always admire when I see past presidents, from both parties, converge together for a cause, and they warmly greet each other.  But it seems those days are gone.  Contentiousness is not attractive on anyone.  Please make it easier for not just me to vote, but for all of us.\", 'The best way to earn my vote is by showing me honesty.

I am tired of hearing the same old promises presidents before you and the presidents before them and the presidents before them have blindly to America and will continue to do so because you feel that will be enough.

If you want my vote, then you also need to be sincerely concerned about religious prejudice in this country.', 'Neither of the two current candidates deserve the office one is a hate filled race monger and the other is one of the most corrupt individuals to run for office in the history of this country.

(Male)', 'I would tell the candidates this year that one of the surest ways to lose my vote is to keep telling me what they think I want to hear, instead of what I know to be true.  For the democratic candidate, I would tell them there is absolutely no chance that they would get my vote, no matter what they say.  An often cited quote, attributed to many different individuals, goes something like this, \"If you are not a liberal at 25, you have no heart.  If you are not a conservative at 35, you have no brain.\"  This fits me exceptionally well.  But that is not to say I will blindly vote conservative.  To the republican candidate (presumably Trump), I would say that he needs to be careful what he says and how he is portrayed in the media.  This election will be won or lost less by facts and more by public opinion.  I would be just fine casting my vote for a third-party candidate. (Male)', 'For Hillary Clinton, I would tell her there\\'s basically nothing she can do to earn my vote. I am sick of the scandals that follow her and her family. I would really rather have Bill for another term than her because I find truly disgusting her apparent entitlement to the \"throne.\" I am disgusted in particular by her advocacy of \"women\\'s rights,\" which I disagree with morally, but which I also find hypocritical in her since she has allied herself with Bill as he victimized women. I find her actions in the Benghazi matter horrible. For Donald Trump, who I am almost certainly going to vote for, though I do have reservations (ie he seems tyrannical), I would like to see him follow through on putting an end to illegal immigration (not singling out banning Muslims or a religious group though--that sets a bad precedent). I\\'d like to see no foreign wars and empire building. In his case, I would really be comforted and made comfortable to vote for him knowing that he would refrain from all of the executive actions and orders that Obama (in a precedent starting with Bush) isn\\'t afraid to use.  Those are an overreach of executive authority. I\\'d also like to see more fiscal responsibility. And for him to stop putting his foot in his mouth! (Female)', 'I generally am more interested in the most common issues that are debated: education, jobs, economy, and all other domestic and international affairs. The candidate can earn my vote if he or she falls into line or has similar thoughts as myself. This will not be only an issues-based election, though. I will see how he or she handles pressures or stressors, etc. (Male)', '[What do you mean by fall in line?] Meaning that if we have similar beliefs, then the candidate could potentially secure my vote.', \"The most important thing to me for a presidential candidate is not your views, but it is your character.

The minds of Americas tomorrow is in those classrooms. I write to try to convince you to better education for all of us. Sincerely, Jessica (Female)', 'I am honestly not sure what I would say to Hilary. I just know that for her to have any chance at earning my vote she would have to convince me that she is not as corrupt as I believe her to be.

What are you going to do for the working class?  We need a better minimum wage, please!', 'Dear Presidential Candidates, this is anonymous so I will tell you up front; neither of you whether republican or democrat are my first choice, or even second choice, so from the beginning of your candidacy, I have very mixed feelings. Neither of you seem to have the moral, ethical, or spiritual fiber that I would hope for in a president. While you both may have a certain amount of life and legal experience, neither one of you has the clear outward \"presidential persona\" that seems to be helpful to be a world leader. Neither one of you have my confidence that you will make the best decisions for our country philosophically, regarding government or military situations. Neither of you speak of your own personal faith or any personal struggles and how you have dealt with them morally or spiritually. You both seem to lack humility and contrition whenever you have screwed up. You may have said you were sorry or apologized but the sincerity was little more than what you get when two 8yr olds in a school yard scuffled are forced to shake hands and \" say you\\'re sorry\". I just don\\'t know what to think. I could say Hillary, you have had the experience of being in the white house already, but your husband was a disgrace to the presidency and you would have done well to divorce him and separate yourself from him, but instead, you stood by him, only to be able to emotionally blackmailing him into getting his cronies to eventually support your campaign, if not flat out BUY your campaign. I would have way more respect for you if you had left him and then your platform would be significant as the first woman presidential candidate, but since you didn\\'t, I see a vote for you as a continuation of the presidency of Bill Clinton, Liar, Adulterer and public disgrace to the White House, the Office of the presidency of the USA and to our country and everything it stands for. To you Donald Trump, I know your \"comb over \" is your trademark, but it looks ridiculous and is not the \" presidential look\" I would hope for in someone who lacks actual political experience but who now seems to really want to win the presidential race. So now I have to explain, when you first announced your name was going in the hat for this race, we (I) thought it was a joke. We figured you had enough expendable money to get in and \"stir the pot\" like Russ Perot did several years ago and get the other candidates talking about the issues etc. We never really believed you were serious...I mean who wears their hair like a middle aged has been used car salesman? We could say well you have a lot of business experience, because of your successful business status, but wait.... how many times have you filed bankruptcy? You may call it business strategy, but to file ch 13 so many times for the same business no less, is shameful to me. Then there\\'s the issue of marriage, yes you believe in it (at least 4 times) but you also seem to believe in divorce equally or almost equally as much (if statistics are to be trusted, you will probably divorce wife #3 or is it #4 as well. Do you have a moral compass? If not, when and how will you get one? Or will you hire a committee and borrow theirs? It would be nice to know more about these candidates than what we see on front of newspapers, trash magazines, and opponents campaign ads. It would be nice to know that they are made of something real and see some honesty in their words, not propaganda for or propaganda against various \"hot topics\" I will be prayerfully seeking insight as to which of you will be the \"lesser of two evils\" and least likely to: disgrace our country or bring us to social, financial, and political ruin as a world power.', \"Ms. Clinton, I would like to know the truth about your dealings with these emails??

I don't want to vote for either! Dear candidates, right now, neither one of you stand for the same things I do and you do not seem like people I want to run my country. I don't feel like I can trust you. It can be hard to trust any politician these days, but there are definitely others I trust more. I am tired of the lying from you, Hillary. Donald, I can't stand your views on immigration or on women. You seem like a jerk. I will vote for you, Donald, but I would feel much better if I felt like you had the country's best interest at heart instead of just wanting to hear yourself talk.

However, more than a stance on any one issue, I am looking for a person of integrity. Someone who would make a good leader without feeling the need to belittle or bully others to make themselves look better. I am also looking for someone that can work TOGETHER with people with differing viewpoints. If you can show me how you can or will do that, then you have my vote.\", 'Dear Candidate: While all elections are important, this election is even more important than most as it appears the next president will most likely nominate up to three candidates for Supreme Court Justice.  Also, as we see the rise in ISIS and terror both home and abroad, continued levels of underemployment or unemployment, and a porous border and continued illegal immigration, I want a president who is not afraid to make the tough decisions.  I want a president who will address these issues while balancing the budget and begin the slow process of decreasing our national debt.  I want my children to have a country they will be proud to inherit and lead in the future.  These times require not being popular but being strong and moral in leadership.  These are the characteristics that I will watch for in determining who I will vote for in November.', 'I would ask that as you continue your campaign, you keep to the current politics and run a \"clean campaign\". I think mudslinging says a lot more about the person doing the slinging than the opponent. I also feel very strongly that the gap between the richest and poorest person is becoming more substantial. I would like to know how you\\'re going to improve upon that and how you\\'re going to help the working poor.  A plan to help those who tend to fall between the cracks, those who aren\\'t poor enough to get any of the help they desperately need while having those more fortunate pay more would get my vote.', \"Mr. Trump, most of what I've heard of from you is just terrible racist comments about the people in America as well as the Jewish population.  You are also anti-Israel, which being pro- Israel is very important to me.  I don't think we need a dictator for a president. you suck and your fired!!!! Mrs. Clinton, I haven't heard much from you.  Instead of voting for the TV whore, you are what's left. I guess you could say I'm picking the lesser of 2 evils.  Some of the stuff you did in office I didn't really agree with.  I don't recall what they are right now. (due to my MS).\", \"No, faith (at least Christian faith) doesn't necessarily play a strong role (at least when deciding between Christians and secular people). I'm looking for an effective and good leader, not a Christian. Often, the two roles don't align. Jimmy Carter was a Christian, and he was one of the worst presidents we ever had. I would also be very leery of voting for an evangelical in general, because I am sick and tired of the Republican party high jacking evangelicalism and making a mockery of it by their bad governing or stupidity. In terms of Christians though, even though I am evangelical, I would tend to consider a Catholic person more seriously than any other, secular or Christian, with the idea in mind that they might have some classical training in political philosophy (evangelicals usually don't.).\", 'Before it came down to the currently remaining 2 candidates, I would say yes, religion matters or faith if you prefer that word. Now it seems pretty clear to me that neither really has any faith or religion or spiritual life whatsoever. I personally think that they BOTH give the impression that they are lost souls, out for money, power, prestige, etc. I think that a person of faith has a potential to make a better president if they are Christian or Jewish but not other faiths like Islam, because of the teachings that specifically say not Muslims are \"infidels\" and should be killed if they are not willing to follow Islam. Our country was founded upon a desire for religious freedom, but during a time where the current culture was predominantly Judeo-Christian and it was agreed that separation of church and state would insure religious freedom regardless of the religion of the president or governor or any political office (at least on paper). In Islam however, their belief that Islam is the ONLY acceptable religion, it is plausible that an Islamic president could garner enough support from Islamic community, to abolish separation of church and state. We need only look to the Middle East where Islam is the state religion officially making it either illegal to be Christian or financially impossible to be Christian. So, if a Muslim or Muslim sympathetic candidate were running for office, I could not vote for them.', \"I wish faith or religion would play a role in this presidential election. But due to the nature of the two unappealing candidates, I am going to vote for the one who has lied the least and killed the fewest people. I did like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Dr. Ben Carson due to their Christian principles, but of course, none of them are available. I do think that although Trump is not a Christian or even ethical person, I believe he will take better care of the US than the guy in there now who hates my white skin and Christianity, and far better care than the lying woman who continues to skate through lies with immeasurable corruption. Trump at least claims to be a Christian, not sure what the Clinton stance is but whatever it is, I'll bet you a dollar it's a total lie. She reminds me of the chronic liar on SNL played by John Lovitz a few years back.\", \"I do think it's important that a person who leads our country has some faith. Whether it's the faith I choose to believe in is irrelevant to me. I would not necessarily be more likely to vote for one candidate over the other just because they professed to be religious, though. I think a lot of things can be said on the campaign trail and I don't believe those words are always true or followed through with. I believe actions speak louder than words. As in Donald Trump has not been very forthcoming with his business practices and Hillary Clinton has not been honest in her email dealings. I think both of their actions say more about them as people than the words they speak.\", 'I think if the President does have a good basis for faith that it’s fantastic! It would hopefully bring them to a humbling attitude and make them question right from wrong judgment. Unfortunately, though this country is where money talks not faith. I really doubt one person would change that too. That would have to come from generations of small change or an apocalypse. If a president isn\\'t a person of faith which I\\'m pretty sure is Donald Trump, that\\'s the personality you get. The \"hey what has faith done for me, I haven\\'t seen any progress\". You get a cold and blunt personality and a side of no compassion for the weak or sick.', 'Honestly I think it makes a huge difference to the majority of America what religion or even if a candidate is even religious at all. What kind of gets me is that for a nation that risked just about everything to separate ourselves from religious oppression we sure do weigh a lot against you if you are not the \"right\" religion. It’s just sad that everyone thinks that their religion is the \"right\" one and instead of being understanding they shut out others. The majority of Conservative politicians are portrayed as trustworthy or honorable when in reality those are the ones who end up being the most manipulative or greedy.', 'I don\\'t think it makes as big a difference as people tend to make of it. I think being a person of faith can help you be a better leader, make more moral decisions. But none of that matters if you don\\'t have good training in governing or have training the wisdom to know the consequences of your actions. Matters aren\\'t usually black and white. Sometimes you might make a decision that ends up hurting your end, moral goal rather than helping it because you didn\\'t know how to govern. If a leader is not a person of faith, I do believe they are more likely to be corrupt. But the alternative still doesn\\'t work any better if you have a leader making stupid decisions that hurt the \"moral\" goal in the long run. (Female)', 'I think I partially answered this question above, but most of the time I think I feel better if the president is a person of faith. I know they have a moral compass that way, even if it differed from mine. I can feel like they are humble enough to pray and seek counsel from G-d, rather than popular opinion polls or committed and focus groups.', \"It makes a tremendous person if the President is a person of faith because of ethics and truthfulness. It made my heart swell with love and pride when Bush (who I didn't care too much for but at least he was Christian) and Reagan would talk about God in their speeches. Right now it can't even be a favor as we have two dishonest individuals vying for top post in this nation. All I can do is pick the one who lies the least and has caused fewer deaths’ That's Trump.\", \"While I would love to have a person of faith in the White House, I understand that it may not happen. My big criteria is that they do what is right and look out for families and small businesses. I don't want to see them catering to the 1% or to their biggest contribution donors. They need to be able to see what is important in the big picture. We need to work on education, veterans, the poor, job creation, and things like that that make American the best place to live.\", \"It's extremely important for the president to be a moral leader. I'd hope that by the time they reached their spot in office that they won't have a lot of debts owed to under the table politicians. I think being an extremely moral leader goes hand in hand with being a person of faith and if you lack faith you lack a certain amount of morals. For me a moral leader would listen to the people's complaints and even if they were conflicting they would have the patience and answers to defend their views and try to get the opposing on their side. A moral leader would not dismiss views just because they are disagreeing with their own.\", 'I believe greatly in morality. Hence, if they are not a moral leader, then I cannot vote for them at all. Someone who does not have morality is someone who thinks they can do anything even playing god. Someone who is moral will respect values and life and the country they govern over. A moral leader would watch over the country and make decisions based on the citizens needs and beliefs. They would not just make decisions on a whim that would cause more terrorism like Obama. They would focus their attention on the right things and not all of the fluff in the bills they sign and they would read everything to ensure that there is no corruption in the House or Senate.', 'Extremely important!!! There was a time when a presidential candidate would be forced to drop out of the race when he was caught cheating on his wife. Clinton was the first in your face drop of morals. I could not believe he was not impeached for all his under-handed actions while President. For security clearance reasons alone he should have been in trouble. We need to reset our moral compasses with a great leader.', 'It is important for my president to NOT be a moral leader.  Shut up about that, ok?  That is the very last thing I want or need.  Should I require moral guidance or leadership, I will look to my elders or clergy; I will pray and/or read the Bible.  The last place I would look for moral leadership is the president.  Run the country and stay out of religion, please.', \"I want the president to be a moral leader, because he or she is one, regardless of their preference to be one or not. They become an instant celebrity and role model for young people all over the world as well. Bill Clinton disgraced the office of the President in nearly every possible way. Having sex in Oval Office, having adulterous sex in the Oval Office, and elsewhere, then allowing it to be plastered all over the media. He denied so many accusations of sexual affairs or mistresses etc., it was just unbelievable and inconceivable, that he could be innocent of any, much less all of them. Now I think young people who grow up with ambition to be president, no longer value character or morals, because presidents like Bill Clinton (and to be fair maybe even Richard Nixon) didn't seem to need morals religion ethics etc. to be president. I would hope that whoever is elected would stand up, apologize for previous indiscretions and lack of morals and exemplify what a good respectable and ethical presidency would be and be a good moral role model for today's youth, instead of being an embarrassment to America as well as the Western World.\", \"I think it is very important that the president be a moral leader. Whether he or she likes it or not, the eyes of the nation and the rest of the world are watching.  I think some of the things mentioned in the previous question are very important   In addition, I think while people understand that the president is not at liberty to discuss some things that are classified, it's still important to be truthful and not misleading.\", 'tivity 2:  Tone of The Campaign for President', 'w would you describe the tone that the presidential candidates are taking?  How do you feel about the tone they are taking?  How important is a civil debate in the way Presidential candidates speak and address their supporters and opponents?  How would you describe a civil tone in politics to a friend? What would it look like?  Give examples of politicians you view as people who promote or do not promote a civil debate?', \"The tone is very negative. I am completely turned off by both candidates. They are not being transparent. Trump not owing up to his false facts and Clinton not admitting her past mistakes and being very dismissive. A civil tone in politics is very important. It's important for supporters to see an even tempered and controlled personality. It should be one that allows opponents to disagree but in a respectful and truthful manner. Bullying, name calling and using an angry, yelling tone of voice Is not acceptable. Trump does NOT promote a civil tone. Clinton slings mud when she's not being truthful but she is more of a civil toned person. President Obama is calm, cool and collected=civil tone.\", \"I think Donald Trump is extremely hostile. Just hearing him start to speak, his tone of voice makes me nervous. He seems aggravated all the time and I am not sure he is a logical person. He thinks he is always right and doesn’t seem to want to listen to another person’s point of view. That is disturbing to me. You have to be open minded as President. Hilary seems very level headed. She seems logical. I am not sure how tough she would be in illegal immigration. Trump seems tougher with that. I think Hilary would put families first and take a stand with our military. A civil debate is very important to me when they speak to supporters and opponents. They have to have respect for all people. Even if you disagree with someone it is important to hear their point of view so they feel respected. Otherwise people will not want to listen to you. I think it is in a candidate's best interest to act logically. A civil tone in politics is when candidates do not speak over each other, they do not yell at each other and they do not call each other names. It would be a somewhat tough talk, but not too tough and not too friendly either. Mike Huckabee, Hilary Clinton, Ben Carson all promote a civil debate. Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz do not promote a civil debate.\", 'The last debate I watched I thought it was awful/ They need to stop blaming and mudslinging each other. Start getting to the real issues. Healthcare. Debt', \"The tone of all presidential elections ends up being downright nasty.  The candidates are more worried about pointing out flaws in each other and promising more than they are about building their image and honoring their promises.  Our debates have sunk to a level of not answer the questions, not following your time limits, making sure the others don't get full advantage of their times, and going for the biggest shock values.  Presidential debates closer resemble gladiatorial fights than political discourse.  Where candidates should be stating their ideas on big button issues and working to win people over to their way of thinking they are instead trying to avoid the issues and make each other look bad.  I have NEVER seen a civil political debate.  Every candidate is guilty of this modern debating style.\", \"There has been such negativity and bullying in the primary and presidential debates this term that it is very uninspiring and disappointing. I have always been advised to surround yourself with positive people because negativity breeds negativity. I understand that politics is a 'game' unto itself but it gotten so ridiculous how most of the candidates have lowered themselves in the public eye, except for folks like John Kasich, Rand Paul, Martin O'Malley, Mike Huckabee who have stayed away from direct and personal attacks on each other's character.   These candidates all fell to the wayside while Donald Trump rose to the top based on change, fury and controversy.  I certainly wish that the way we could inspire the majority of folks was not by tearing down but by building up. Bernie Sanders for the most part ran a positive campaign of change too. I think that it really is vital to teach our youth, disadvantaged and uneducated that the way to be a proponent of change is to inspire and promote civil discussions where respect when addressing others is the key to true productive conversation.  Candidates can become excited in political discussions but making personal attacks is uncalled for.\", \"The tone that they are taking is one of a condescending one. When it comes to each other, they bash each other and try to defend themselves. They are not focusing on the actual issues enough, but rather he did this and she did that. I do not like that tone. I believe it should be a more focused tone. They should not play like school children fighting, but rather focus their energy on tasks at hand. Because of all the negative comments and advertising and bashing, the true points don't really come out. All it does is get people riled up, when instead there should be productive debates where people are given things to think about regarding their candidates when they are done speaking such as yes I believe that or no that doesn't fit my own beliefs. I believe it is important to have a civil debate, but not one where the candidate simply rags on the other person and riles the crowd up to support them. It should be more of explaining their platform and answering questions truthfully, not like a politician. It is important to have that because some who may not believe in the candidate or vice versa may change their minds about the candidate. I would try to explain it to a friend by explaining that their tone is to try to get you on their side. They can be persuasive and manipulative in how they choose their words to get you to come to their side. The tone is somewhat of a sly fox in the hen house. The fox is able to persuade all the hens to follow him to dinner, which then they become dinner. This means that all of the sly comments and promises can persuade you to vote for them, but then the real truth comes out eventually, so beware. Someone like Donald Trump will promote it because then he can take charge of the situation and ensure that he comes out on top for the outcome of the debate. Someone like Hillary Clinton I would think that would not like a debate with her public email account hanging over her. I would think she would be more afraid of being called out on that.\", 'I think a debate is very important. It gives the voters a chance to hear the politicians view next to each other and be able to hear the cons of each from the opposing politician. I think right now the tone is every poor. I think there is a lot of mudslinging going on from the Trump side.', 'I think the tone of the debates on the Republican side is just awful and about as crazy as it can get. Mr. Trump not only cusses like a sailor that most of the time on TV it is just one big bleep from his foul language. Mr. Trump is always calling his opponents names and acts so uncivil towards people that do not have the same idea as him that he just shows how unpredictable he is. As an example he is just rude to Fox newscaster Megan Kelly it is embarrassing and uncalled for. Ms Clinton runs a cleaner more appropriate debate and campaign. Ms. Clinton is clearer on the issues that are put to her and she treats both her supporters and opponents all with respect. The debates with her and Mr. Trump has Mr. Trump yelling and cussing and Ms. Clinton staying focused and acting civil. It is like night and day in watching the debates with Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton with Mr. Trump not answering questions on the issues and not staying focused and then the name calling and racist remarks start and Ms. Clinton staying on point and more interesting to watch. No young kids should watch the debates with Mr. Trump involved. I think that former Gov. Jeb Bush showed a good example as how a civil debate should be run as well as Bernie Sanders ran a very clean well thought out debate as well.', 'I am embarrassed how this Presidential Campaign “tone\" has become so negative. They’re really haven\\'t been any positive or uplifting aspects in this campaign. Not only do the candidates fight amongst themselves, they also are disingenuous in regards to their supporters. I haven\\'t decided if this is a tactic that there are using to confuse voters, or if they think that name calling is acceptable. Politics has morphed into ugliness. I can\\'t think of a Politician who hasn\\'t engaged in this new tactic of name calling and negativity. A civil tone in politics, in my opinion would be one where a Politician sticks to the facts, such as defining the problem, and how they would resolve the problem. Instead they use confrontation that confuses the issue.', \"The tone I take that the candidates are trying to portray is one of blunt force and one of balancing political correctness/incorrectness. I think Hillary is a puppet for her money financiers. And thankfully even though I'm not a democrat a lot of female democrats I know aren't falling for the female power card. I think it's the strings she has pulled which are keeping her out of prison right now because just like in middle class America that I've experienced it's still really all about who you know in order to be heard or getting a foot in the door. Her tone is misleading and very passive on exactly whatever she's trying to portray. I think Donald is the most bold one because he's not working under anyone else's money but his own so he can throw those million and billionaires out to hang who are supporting his opponents and it looks great for TV. One thing I love about how this political race is turning out is the fact so many hidden money backers are coming to the light. We are seeing for the first time who are pulling the strings of these candidates. That's the one aspect I respect in Donald Trump is that since he owns his money he can do his own talking unlike Hillary who if elected will have a lot of debts to pay in Wall Street investors. I think the fact that so many non-politicians ran this race (even though one remains) it proves America has been slowly waking up to the fact that politicians have been nothing but a face for financial backers who are really the ones pulling the strings in the nation's say of what happens or not. I love reading about Brexit too in regards to waking up in a sense. A civil debate is of great importance! It gives Americans a chance to see how each candidate will respond when posed with the questions were all dying to hear the answer to. It also gives opportunity to see each candidate against each other and judges them on character, poise and especially these debates cunning underhand remarks of he said she said. I am so looking forward to Hillary and Donald's debates. Donald isn't very good at debating at all, however his one handed slap remarks occasionally get the audiences in uproars either positive or negatively and create fantastic TV. These civil debates will be fascinating because Donald does not shy away from name dropping and bringing new light to hidden agendas. I'm curious to see who he brings up from Wall Street in regards to Hillary since New York is his hometown turf too. I would describe civil tone in politics to a friend by explaining candidates are taking a new approach to reach the hearts of Americans by letting us in to more of behind scenes of who's running who. They're including Americans in the conversation and are talking to us in a tone of lowered English so it's easier to understand certain terms they want to get across as well as defining their opponent. They encourage Americans to get involved in what they believe in. An example of a civil tone politician would be Bernie Sanders. His love for the lower classes really shows not only on but off the platform by his decisions to seat coach on an airplane, address every equally and really believes in his messages. Someone who doesn't promote civil debate was Ted Cruz. He is a classic example of a politician who says things he thinks the audience wants to hear and basically answers the question for you. He just really doesn't understand how Americans are evolving in to this simplistic form of speech and response. He tried to continue dying strategies of winning which in the end lost his place in the running.\", \"I do not believe Mr. Trump has taken a civil tone throughout his campaign. He lies and slanders other people’s name. Ms. Clinton has been more civil (though to be fair I have not been following her campaign much). In order to have a useful debate for the citizens to gain knowledge and make decisions about a candidate, the candidates have to be civil. This means, not attacking each other and getting into a screaming match. I think a civil tone requires candidates to speak about the issues that are important without slandering their opponent. When asked questions directly about their opponent, they need to be respectful in their answer. It's ok to say you disagree with someone, but name calling and mockery are extremely uncivil. I recently saw a great clip from Senator John McCain's Presidential campaign. A member in the audience said something about Obama that was not true. The Senator politely corrected the person and gave Obama the respect he deserves a human being.\", 'I think the tone of the debates on the Republican side is just awful and about as crazy as it can get.

Aggressive at times. I feel it diminishes the campaign and takes away from the areas of interest. A debate is important for the voter to appraise what the issues are of importance to the candidate, as well as how professional and informed the candidates are. A civil tone in politics would be the example of the PBS show \"Point Taken\", in which individual topics are explored via various means. Not like a referee match.', \"The tone some of the presidential candidates have taken is juvenile. The name calling and bullying is ridicules.  I'm almost embarrassed by our options. With three candidates in the presidential race there are clearly differing opinions.  They must take a civil tone so we can actually hear what they think about the issues.  As a voter I need to hear the candidates’ views on the issues and what their plans are to address the issues.\", 'Several examples of politicians who promote a civil debate come to mind: John Kasich - He tried very hard to keep the debates civil.  When he disagreed with one of the other candidates he simply said he disagreed and immediately went into his thoughts.  No yelling, interrupting or name calling. Gary Johnson - Gary Johnson is the Libertarian candidate for President.  He does not speak badly about the other candidates.  He sticks to the issues and has explicitly said he will not engage in disrespectful rhetoric.', 'There are two politicians that do not promote a civil debate: Donald Trump - While I agree with his stance on many issues I can\\'t get past how he constantly belittles people with name calling and interrupting.  His arrogance is unbelievable.  I find myself remembering a quote I heard long ago, \"What you do speaks so loudly that I can\\'t hear what you are saying\". Hillary Clinton - She isn\\'t much better than Trump with her arrogance.  How can you have a civil debate with constant interruption and yelling?', 'As I said the Presidential race this year is contentious.  The tone is something that I\\'m embarrassed about.  We know each party has different ideology, but to bring it down to a level where the past is mucked up and spouses are brought into the picture, doesn\\'t bode well on the character of either candidate.  I personally feel as if we are being dumbed down by making the race seem more like a \"look at me\" instead of \"look what I can do\".  A civil tone would be leaving personal feelings at the door, and concentrate on what each candidate wants to do and how they are going to do it, not mock the other\\'s plan.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t think of any politicians that are the voice of reason, but I think Paul Ryan is trying to bring some sanity to the Republicans.  I wouldn\\'t say there are politicians promoting uncivil debate, but I don\\'t think anyone is stepping up to the plate to stop it.  I don\\'t think the moderators of the debates have been very helpful in trying to keep the tone civil', \"I don't think Trump has much respect for other people unless he feels that they have been as successful as he has. Clinton has been accused of being a liar although it seems all political candidates lie. They say woman have to prove themselves much more so than a man, so I wonder if there is any possibility that she can win. Trump has been insulting her and many others. She hadn't been so bad in an outright manner. Those are my thoughts.\", \"I think the tone is getting very personal.  There is so much name calling.  It is so immature.  These are the people that are supposed to run out country.  I think a civil debate is very important.  The voters have to think that the candidate they vote for is able to run the country and make very crucial decisions.  Right now that doesn't seem that this can happen.  Donald Trump certainly does not promote a civil debate.  His ego is so big and his ideas are so off the wall.  It is very scary.\", 'The tine of this election is anything buy civil with trump spreading hate and bigotry and personal attacks he was doing it before this election and it qill just continue to get worse as time goes on. Civil debate in a campaign is very important without it people do not want to vote. Bernie and Hillary have both been civil when it comes to debating even when they do not agree on the other Hand Trump has not been civil with anyone that he has come in contact with putting down other candidates attacking them and their families and throwing temper tantrums because news anchors asked him questions he did not want to answer her is nothing but a spoiled child. A civil tine in politics is when individuals even threw differing view are able to express their opinions and standings while the other listens and responds without attacking or making the debate personal an exchanging of ideas through taking and rebuttal. I believe both Hillary and Bernie promote and engage in civil debate. (Male)', \"I think the candidates are taking a very critical tone of each other. Trump isn't afraid to call names, but Hillary isn't above making unfair, mean comments either. I'd prefer the tone to stay more professional, focused on issues. But I don't want the candidates to refrain from criticizing each other and attacking each other on issues that are important to the campaigns: policy issues and personal issues that are relevant to holding office. It's important how leaders address their supporters and adversaries, I guess, to prove they're a dignified leader, but again, I prefer when people aren't afraid to attack on issues that matter. For example, I hated that Bernie Sanders refused to criticize Clinton on the email scandal. He had an open area of attack. I think a civil tone in politics would be one that was not afraid to have a heavy handed attack where necessary, on issues that matter, but wouldn't make nasty comments about irrelevant matters (person's looks, etc...) or use rude or mean language in general. I think Bernie Sanders is the only one I can come up with who promotes more civil debate. He doesn't descend into name calling, but for too long he didn't attack where it mattered. He could have done so and still remained civil. Donald Trump obviously doesn't promote civil debate (name calling of Ted Cruz, rude to Megyn Kelly), but Hillary also allowed those women in New Hampshire to nastily criticize all younger females for not voting for a woman, as if gender is a relevant issue for choosing a candidate (it's not). (Female)\", \"I feel there are two completely different tones right now in this race. Trump is more or less on the defense (whether he believes this or not is no matter) due to his outspoken nature. A majority of the voters are just about fed up with his misogynistic and racist views. On the other hand, you have Clinton who is on the offensive and using Trump's words against him. However, she deals mostly with the private e-mail fiasco. Although many people, including myself, enjoy the barbs exchanged during debates, they can be quite annoying as well. I much prefer a civil tone because it shows how he or she works under pressure with the spotlight on him or her. If I were to describe it to a friend, a civil debate would include no shouting, yelling, talking over one another, and things of that nature. In recent memory, one that stands out is Barack Obama. Another who stands out to me is John F. Kennedy when debating Nixon. (Male)\", \"I think the tone of this particular election cycle, and with this group of political candidates, will be decidedly hostile, maybe even violent.  I am extremely concerned with the last 6 months of this year.  The candidates are increasingly hostile towards each other, and their supporters are jumping on this bandwagon.  Between protests at speeches and anti-candidate actions taking place, this is going to be a defining cycle in our country's history. Politics are a divisive topic to start with, so it is hard to come up with a specific politician who promotes civil debate.  I would go so far as to say that civil debate has not existed in the United States in over 25 years. (Male)\", 'The tone of the current candidates for the most part seems to be one of superiority. I don\\'t like the current state of tone in presidential politics. It is very important for Presidential candidates to address both their supporters and opponents with kindness and humility. I don\\'t see that at all right now. A civil tone to me would look like someone who isn\\'t seeking to be \"right\" or \"win\" but one who cares for the questioner. A good example would be the way that Jesus responds to his friends and critics. I think Barack Obama is a great example of one who promotes civil debate. On the other hand, I think Hillary Clinton is one who is not civil in tone. (Male)', \"Honestly, the amount of cattiness going on between candidates is childish. I want my leader to be effective in communicating, even when they're criticizing someone. Of course a candidate is going to point out another's weaknesses to show where they themselves are strongest, but you don't have to smear a person to do that. I can't stand Hilary, but she does do a bit better job of promoting a civil debate than Trump. Sanders used to be good at it as well, but he started getting catty in the past couple of months. I'm a bit ambiguous when it comes to Obama, but I think he was a prime example of someone who could successfully promote a civil debate. (Female)\", 'Right now, I think that they are taking a negative tone. This is the point where they are all trying to dig up dirty laundry. I do not enjoy that they are doing that. I think that it is extremely important that the candidates address the supporters as well as the opponents so that we know what they are thinking. I would describe a civil tone as being able to talk calmly while still being able to get your point across. I think that Bernie Sanders was great at having the civil tone. He wanted to help the people and he made sure that it was voiced. He also gave time to hear out his opponent. That is a civil debate, but what is happening now is not. It is just dirty laundry and desperation. (Female)', \"I feel that the Presidential tones are extreme on either end of the spectrum, very liberal Hillary or very conservative Donald Trump. Both sides are equally mouthy and too full of themselves and what they view as the correct path for the nation to take. Their heads are lodged so far up inside themselves that it's a wonder they're still sucking air. A civil tone in politics is level, cool, logical and temperate. Both sides are given equal opportunity to speak, and at the end of it all, we agree to disagree, and move on without blowing the world up. Trump and Clinton are uncivilized. Bernie Sanders uses a proper civil tone. (Male)\", \"I would describe the tone as being combative - on both sides. The tone has been far from civil. In fact, I don't think uncivil is even the right way to describe it; the tone has been vindictive. I feel stressed and anxious about the state of the presidential election based on the combative tone of the candidates. I believe that it is very important for a presidential candidate to speak civilly and with decorum. The average American may not ever meet the president, but they know how he/she behaves and acts based on the way they present themselves. I would describe a civil tone as honest and firm on convictions with no ambiguity. It would look sincere. Politicians that I believe promote civil debate are Speaker Paul Ryan, and honestly that's the only person I can think of right now. (Female)\", \"I feel like both presumed nominees are both embellishing themselves and really degrading the other candidate. I personally felt Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Bernie Sanders all did the best jobs of promoting civil discussions in the Primary Debates. A civil tone in debate is really as simple as avoiding all of the disruptive basic logical fallacies people learn in classical education or in the early years of many colleges. It's really hard to for me to get a clear view of what the candidates want if they don't do this on a regular basis. (Male)\", 'Ok, the tone...Well the tone thus far has been aggressive. But that is nothing new in American politics. Candidates repeatedly sling mud at one another, call each other names, and do everything in their power to make their opponents look terrible. I for one am sick of it. We are all supposed to be adults. It is ok to disagree with one another without trying to crush the other. I realize that I\\'m asking for an unattainable ideal, but a guy can dream. Civility. We go back to what I wish we could have. A true debate and discussion. Not just an argument and name calling. This is not the blame game. I think it should be very important for the candidates to have a truly civil debate, and answer the questions with more than just pointing out how terrible their opponent is. I think Ben Carson was an excellent example of a civil candidate. He was thoughtful, responsive, and talked about what he would do if he were elected. Trump, even though he is likely to be getting my vote, is a terrible example. In fact, he is probably the worst example I can think of. But other candidates are bad too. Even Gary Johnson called Trump a \"pussy\" (pardon me) on camera. REALLY??? You are trying to become the most powerful man in the world and you are going to use language like that on camera? That is just sad. (Male)', 'So far I would say the tone that the presidential candidates are taking has been very negative. I feel that all of the discourse so far has been centered on personal attacks towards the opposing candidate, while both candidates only offer meaningless, repetitive slogans when asked what they would actually do as president. Trump in particular has defied any sort of decency in the way that he insults and demeans women, racial minorities, and veterans. I think that it is crucial to democracy that civility is conducted by the presidential candidates. The American public must be informed of problems that we face and understand opposing approaches in order to choose what they believe is best. The current election has proved not even to be a popularity contest, but a contest for who can be the least hated of the two. A civil tone would look like a rational debate between the candidates, in which relevant and important questions are discussed and realistic and detailed solutions are offered. I think it would be refreshing to have a debate without moderators who bait the candidates into ad hominem attacks upon each other. In terms of examples of political figures, I would say that individuals such as Donald Trump and Chris Christie do not promote civil debate, because their performance in formal debates and their general public persona show little more than political theater. I think that politicians like Ben Carson, Barack Obama, and Ron Paul do promote civil debate because the answers they offer to questions are thoughtful and on topic. (Male)', \"I believe this election will have long lasting and global effects. With everything that has been going on in just the past 6 months or so, it's obvious to me that a liar such as Hillary cannot be in charge. Though, I do question Trumps faith at times when he makes sly remarks, I feel he is at least honest. (Male)\", 'I believe the main tone of the candidates has been combative and insulting against one another. I really feel like it is a waste of time to insult the other candidate. It only comes across as completely biased and immature. A civil tone would be one that only focuses on the policies and issues and only mentions the opposing candidate in an attempt to compare policies and explain why yours are superior. Donald Trump does not debate in a civil manner. He spends much of the time name calling and promoting himself for superficial reasons. (Female)', \"The current state of the presidential election I could describe the tone as being manipulative. I feel like the two candidates, one being Trump in particular, are more worried about being liked so they say whatever they have to, to get people on their sides. This infuriates me to no end. The reason we have elections and candidates is for the issues we have and to speak about them and how they are going to change them! To be the head of this country, I believe one must be very educated. When someone is wanting to be the leader of the country you must act in a dignified manner and be able to hold a civil conversation and debate. I think that is highly important that the candidates speak to each other, the nation, their supporters, and to the press in a dignified and well-manners way. If our future President cannot speak to their fellow American as an equal and without hostility, how can they seek peace with hostile countries and avoid dragging the United States into a war. We have all seen Trumps rally's and his speeches, we have seen his campaign from the start. I, personally, was hoping it was all a joke, but that is one very long example of how not to act. He comes off arrogant and rude. He makes faces and comments against anyone else speaking. Do we want someone so simple-minded as President? He says what he wants to get people on his side, he's a manipulator, and I believe he is just bored with his own failing businesses and decides to run for office. [You speak of an educated candidate and I wish to ask you if you believe the news platforms out there, e.g. social media, newspaper, TV, etc. is giving the public the political information they need to be educated about these candidates and their position on issues? Or are they too concern with the personal?] I do believe that social media is more concerned with the personal and the trivial matters, but watching the debates and watching the rallies, there can’t be anything but simply what the candidate has to say. Now after the debate or rally that is when social media kicks in and starts twisting and turning phrases into what will get them views. (Female)\", 'It is so important. If a candidate responds to protesters in a childish manner, such as what you would hear on a school playground, then that is indicative of how they will act in office. A civil tone would mean that the candidate would address issues people bring up in an understanding manner. Such as, \"I understand where you\\'re coming from and why you feel that way. These are the reasons I believe what I believe, and thank you for bringing insight for me to understand your viewpoint on this issue.\" What is not a civil tone is making blanket statements about certain groups of people, just to get the crowd going at your rallies. (Female)', \"Our candidates our hostile towards each other and each other's followers. I don't like all the anger and hate speech going on at all. Being civil is very important because they can get their ideas across much better if they are not fighting so hatefully. Ronald Regan had civil debates and got his views and beliefs across to us perfectly. We don't need to know how the candidates feel about each other ...we need to know what they believe in and their solutions to our countries problems.\", \"Since I have not really been following this campaign as of yet, this is a difficult one for me to answer. I have not heard either side first hand, and that is by my choice as I don't plan to do my research on candidates until around October I can only say what I have heard others say about the candidates. The only things others have said are about Donald Trump and his poor treatment of women and minorities. Apparently he has said some very discriminating and offensive things. This is the very reason why I chose to ignore everything in the media at this time of the election process.\", \"Hillary is desperate-sounding, a joke, and shrill.  I literally took a survey asking me what behavior could she DO to win my approval.  But I don't like her.  She is a crony.  Rather she has them.  She is a career politician.  And her tone is NEGATIVE.  I see those ads!  The ones she does not approve of.... right...yuh huh. Donald seems to have no edit button.  This leads to a lot of media misquoting him.  But when I read up on the issue and read his exact quotes...I have no real problem with him.  He is very appealing as it is so clear that he is an outsider, and outlier, and has NO cronies in the political realm.\", \"I personally find the tones of the candidates are taking to be unacceptable. I don't like the name calling, I don't like the put downs, And I don't like the bullying. I think a civil tone is very important, because this is the example for the rest of our country! How they speak while campaigning is a reflection of how they will speak to other heads of state. We don't want to be known as a country that doesn't have any manners or respect ability. A civil tone would be using please, thank you, you're welcome. It would be addressing each other with respect, using I statements, instead of blaming statements. I do not feel that Donald Trump uses a civil tone.\", \"Tone should be firm in expressing their beliefs, but respectful when addressing their opponent. It should be mature not mudslinging ads that just incite hate. Trump, It’s fine to say that you think that Hilary should be convicted of __________, but then state your points that you are aware are facts. It's not ok to use national enquirer style headlines with red stars that look like Star of David symbols. The ONLY thing that saved you from being shut dis is that you didn't use a blue star or blue and white because those colors would have clearly been identified with Israel and Jewish people. To a friend I would explain that a civil debate would require each candidate to allow each other to their time to speak and that when they respond, it's ok to be human and show some feeling, but to respond in a controlled way showing some discipline, restraint, and well, basically, CLASS.\", \"I feel their tone is more to deceive us by cutting the other one down. They sometimes are asked questions and answer saying my opedenendt is more concerned about or so fourth they don't just answer the questions asked. In a debate they should answer what they plan on doing for the country not what they want us to believe the other would do. Asking each other how they plan on executing their plan to get to the promise, be civil to one another.\", \"It really doesn't bother me what the tone of the candidates are as long as they do what they say they are going to do. I don't like a politically correct candidate that is lying. I would prefer them to be truthful not matter what the tone is. if he happens to be outspoken that doesn't bother me as long as he gets the job done. I like Donald Trump’s tone that he's not afraid to say what's on his mind where Hillary strikes me as scared of offending anyone. it isn't really important to be the way the candidates speak as long as the job gets done. I would describe a civil tone as being politically correct which I think is ridiculous. Politically correct would look like a black cloud to me. Donald Trump does not promote being civil but I don't care, Hillary promotes dishonesty.\", \"I am not at all happy with the tone to the campaign at this point.  It feels like they are holding themselves up on a very high pedestal, and talking at voters instead of to them.  Instead of telling us how they are going to fix the problems in this country, they spend their time dragging one another through the mud. or covering up for old mistakes they have made.  To me, Donald Trump does not promote civil debate, you are either on his side and cheering for him, or you are verbally abused by him.  I feel like Bernie Sanders is a little more civil, and tries to be someone that the public can relate to. You feel like he's listening to you!\", 'The tone they are taking... Hillary - She is speaking with the voice of enthusiasm. She speaks with the sliver-coated tongue of profound evil and all that is dishonest. She gets people fired up at things that represent goodness and faith. Trump - He is talking the talk with the tongue that is getting the people fired up against many of the things that have gone awry in our nation. Things like intentional overwhelming illegal immigration and taking out isis killers are the things that are on the mind of people like me. He is crude - the opposite of the silver-coated tongue of evil. Yet he is not totally honest and sincere, and far from an ideal Christian ethical example. He is still far better with his crude remarks than she who speaks with a silver tongue of persuasive, tenacious evil. A civil tone in politics is one that comes from the heart with lies and deceit as its building blocks. I prefer an unscripted somewhat harsh response to a smooth talking liar. This is because to me a \"civil\" debate is one which is built upon the truth and sincerity. Thus it\\'s not what\\'s said that matters as much as how honest and sincere what\\'s being said truly is.', \"I feel that both candidates are doing more to tear the other down than to build up their own campaign. It disgusts me that debates have turned so ugly. I want to hear what they will do and have them leave it at that. If debates were civil, I would hear them both speak and give the others a chance to state their ideas as well. A civil debate would mean no name calling or lashing out. They would show respect towards each other. Trump, for example, is one who resorts to acting like a child. He is rude and offensive. When he speaks about his own ideas, it doesn't even come out as making sense.\", 'I would describe the tone that the presidential candidates are taking as bold but crass with Donald Trump and saying what people want to hear but not necessarily truth or what is needed by Hillary Clinton.  We hear a great deal about \"political correctness\" and I feel this has contributed to the moral decay we are experiencing in America.  I am reminded of some Bible verses as I reflect on tone and how that relates to political correctness.  II Timothy 4:3-4 states \"For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.\" Many in America do not want to hear the truth of how our country has been affected by the moral decay of our society and instead prefer to listen to what \"their itching ears want to hear\". While Trumps’ harshness and crassness can be off putting to my perceived standards of manners, I appreciate that he is not afraid to speak truth in regards to how illegal immigration is affecting our country and how politicians have used the system to help themselves at the expense of others in our country. I think civil debate is important but unfortunately because of political correctness as I discussed above, it is difficult to speak truth and still be perceived as participating in civil debate.  It takes a very gifted person to speak truth as related to God\\'s word in the Bible and not be perceived as judging, uncaring, and discriminating against others.  I have been thankful that Trump is speaking with less swearing but I am glad he does not let himself be constrained by these perceived standards of political correctness. Civil tone is speaking truth but in love to others.  I feel Colossians 4:6 says it best: \"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.\" I felt for the most part Ted Cruz demonstrated a civil tone and promoted civil debate during the primaries.  He was never afraid to speak truth and promote positions that were supported by the US Constitution and when given a chance by individuals in the media or during debates was very good at defending his positions but keeping the tone civil.  I also feel Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Rudy Giuliani are the examples of individuals who are able to explain their positions yet maintain a civil tone.', \"I believe a civil debate atmosphere is crucial to upholding the tenants of the democratic process .... of course in try course of the election campaign there will be vigorous debates and spirited conversations. However, what concerns me is what can be viewed as an angry arrogance from Mr. trump and a segment of his supporters in thrnfi of violence and death threats as well as when trump singed out a particular reporter for publishing what he saw as an unflattering profile of his wife. As a result, from what I've read there were vile regencies to the holocaust rituals that we're offensive this was disturbing and trump didn't not inequitably denounce such acts. So his tone and tics concern me and I value the gop platform but am concerned about the personal under the belt insults .in would describe a civil tone as one that shows respect for the opposition and gives the democratic process the respect it demands you can debate and disagree on the issues but when the line is over crossed with insults it's disturbing\", \"I would describe their tone as combative, which is something I really don't want to listen to. I think a civil debate is very important and should be expected. There is no reason to speak in a disrespectful manner or tone of voice to either your supporters or opponents. Even though I didn't agree with all of his political positions, I liked George W. Bush during his debates since he specifically made it clear where he stood on the issues without being making derogatory comments about others. I think he's a good example of how a presidential candidate should behave during a debate.\", 'I think the current campaign is disgusting, both leading candidates have a lot of skeletons in their closet. I would worry that if a candidate cannot treat their opponent (or others in general!) with respect, they would not be diplomatic in situations where diplomacy is required! I live in Wisconsin and realize our governor is a controversial one but he does speak to others with respect and is well spoken. I think that if a person cannot be put on the hot seat in a debate without verbally lashing out, the person does not have the necessary tact to negotiate or smooth things over if such a need should arise.', \"I'm not sure but I would say to the best of my knowledge that they are civil. I think that they should be civil, they shouldn't talk over one another and shouldn't take personal attacks on each other. Being civil when they address their supporters and opponents is a quality I look for in the candidate as well as what they are saying.  If they can't contain themselves in that situation what will they do in crisis.\", 'uld you describe the tone of the Presidential candidates as civil or not? Please give some examples.', 'I would say Donald Trump is not civil. He keeps calling Hillary \"Crooked Hillary\". He is acting like a child in this way. I don\\'t see how that helps us as a nation. He also has a nasty name for all the people in the Republican party. Calling all Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers is awful. It is just plain stupidity. I think Hillary fights back but in a more subdued way. I don\\'t think she is anything but civil. She never calls Trump by any nasty names. She seems to just state the facts. She is classier.', \"I do not call the tone of the candidates civil when Donald Trump makes personal criticisms about body parts, candidate's wives or facial features of women.  This behavior put the other candidates on the defensive and things snowballed so badly that many candidates wound up participating. Now this does not dismiss the fact that some of the candidates who do not present such obvious offenses still manipulate the media and perform underhanded trickery to try to defeat opponents such as when Ted Cruz upstaged Ben Carson out of votes with false rumors of a campaign being suspended. Deceit can also occur quietly too such as with underhanded deals among the leading democrat contender.\", \"I don't think it is very civil right now. I think politicians right now are focusing more on talking about their oppositions faults and not enough about what they are going to do for the country\", 'The beginning of the debates was really bad with Trump all upset with Megan Kelly the fox newscaster and saying really embarrassing things to her and about her and then   Carson not having a clue what was going on and not being very well informed on most issues. Jeb Bush was very well informed in the debates and spoke well and was very civil.', \"I would describe both Hillary and Donald as civil toned candidates. Donald for sure because he provides so much insight on where money is coming from and information on businesses that are leaving the country. He really talks basic English too and I'm not sure if that comes from the fact he isn't very good at debates or that Americans unfortunately only really relate and understand this type of communication. Hillary is also a civil toned candidate even though I don't believe her she really tries to bring one case examples to her debates. Such as here is so and so off this tribal land and we're fighting for their liberties. She tries to bring a lot of sad front cases to light that really don't have much to do about anything and are very one sided cases.\", 'For the most part I have found it to be a civil as possible between the candidates. It started to get ugly a few times in prior debates but definitely a more civil tone has taken place. For example, at one of the last Republican debates both Cruz and Rubio started to throw jabs at Trump and Trump calmly shot their claims down by restating his stance and maintaining a civil tone.', \"This cycle has not been civil, at all.

I read her bio years ago when her husband was president and thought that to be the truth, but her commercials don't match up with it.\", \"I don't think the tone is civil.  It feels like there is a lack of respect for one another.  I get that they want to win, but I miss the days when our candidates made the effort to win based on how qualified they are rather than focus solely on winning based on how unqualified the other person is. twenty years ago it would be unheard of for a candidate to openly call someone names, like Trump has in the past.\", \"The candidates that are currently left are out to get each other.

I think not only does it make great TV but it's engaging people of all ages to actually start paying attention to the direction this country is going. Bitter and bluntness I see as two separate things. I think Donald is very blunt but makes very valid points and puts Hillary in a light where she has to answer uncomfortable questions not normally in a debate round up and I think it goes the same for her questioning Donald's tactics. I'm very thankful candidates are sort of bullyish this time around because questions are finally being answered and issues being brought to light but I wouldn't call that bitterness.\", \"I think it is true that it has become so bitter.  People only remember all the negative things being said and are not concentrating on anything positive either one of them says. [Who do you think is responsible for the public to only remember the negative things being said? Social media, TV, newspaper, other news platforms, the candidates themselves, other politicians, etc.] I think all of the above.  While watching TV the first thing you hear about a debate is all the negative stuff.  I think we should know what the candidates are saying in their speeches but I don't think it has to be so sensualized. Report first what the candidates are saying they will do for our country.  I have heard people say did you hear what Donald Trump said about women, immigrants, disability.  No one knows what else he said.\", \"I see it that way. American politics is very polarized. I think civil discussion and debate is always possible no matter how different your opinions are. It's the character of the person who determines their behavior in that situation (ex: Bernie Sanders has good character whereas Hillary and Donald don't). We don't have good politicians of good character on either side of the aisle for the most part. That's the real reason we can't have civil discussion. (Female)\", \"I am not sure that I agree with that statement. I believe it just takes two special candidates emerging and running against one another. For example, Kasich and Rubio were mostly civil in the Republican debates and stayed on topic as opposed to veering in another direction.

It may start out that way but once they get into office they seem to get more corrupt.', \"I would tell them that the USA is being faced with a very difficult decision. We have one corrupt candidate that is continuing to try and cover up and lie about past decisions and another that have some good ideas but is a bully. I'm still undecided but leaning towards trump because we need change and new direction BUT hoping he settles down and cleans his act up. Frankly, scared to vote for either as they are both not the ideal candidate...which would be one with a higher moral compass.\", \"I would tell them that I have reservations about both candidates.  Check all the facts and then go with your gut instinct.  I think Donald Trump will set this country back years.  He has no real conviction.

I honestly think President Obama, the first lady, and their family has been an amazing example of leadership for this country. They strive to better this country even when people were against him for the color of his skin.

Therefore, if he were to make an honest a moral presidency, then we could accomplish that. (Female)', 'Would you not want someone who does what they say they are going to do?

Building a wall will only cause us to spend even more money, adding to our budget deficit (Mexico simply isn't going to pay for it, and the protectionist trade policies Trump advocates for funding the wall will only cause strain on the American Middle and Lower Class), and it won't keep the majority of would-be illegal immigrants out.

Who did you have a conversation with? How did they see the tone of the presidential election? Did your faith or the faith of the other person in your conversation play a role in what you discussed?  In what way?', \"I spoke to my friend Jeff.  He agreed with me that there is way too much mudslinging and not enough focusing on things that would actually affect our country.  Our faith wasn't really a factor in the conversation. [Why do you and Jeff believe faith would not guide an individual to support or not support a candidate?] I think most people want to hear about what the candidates will try to do to make our lives better\", 'I spoke to my sister in Florida. And this was her response. The tone of the election is ridiculous!! The serious nature that should guide the election does not. As far as faith guiding my decision not sure if I\\'d call it that as much as I would my gut or instinct. At this point in time I have not decided who to vote for because frankly I\\'m not comfortable with the shenanigans of all of them. I think it\\'s a mockery and it\\'s a true shame that this is where we are heading. [Hello, thank you for speaking to your sister. Could you elaborate on your comment about gut and instinct as your guide for which candidate to support? I am curious, thank you.] This is my sisters view as the election continues I continue to become more annoyed and flip flop between my choice in candidates... I believe it is more of my gut instinct that will guide my final decisions...in other words what at the moment in time seems the best decision... I don\\'t know some may call that relying on their \"faith\" I guess... Or \"beliefs\" ... It will be an informed decision but one I just can\\'t make at this point in time.', \"I talked with my cousin on Tuesday. She says it is very difficult to keep up with all the news that happens. She said it seems there is something new every day. She says she is not happy with either candidate. She is very religious and says she does not see either candidate as a person of faith. She wants the President to have a good relationship with God to help that person make decisions. She and I are of similar faith backgrounds. [I understand if you cannot answer this, but why does your cousin not believe either candidate is a person of faith? What is her definition of faith? Why does she believe the President should have a good relationship with God and what would that look like? Of course, if you have answers of your own to these questions, I welcome them. Thank you.]  I would say my Cousin's definition of a person of faith is someone who references the Bible at times. Also, she believes he or she should be at church at minimum once per week. She believes a President should have a good relationship with God because it says a lot about their character. That they really take seriously the values of God. They care about others more than someone who does not have a relationship with God. I know she and I think the Presidential candidates need to be talking about God in their speeches. We discussed this one day that neither one mentions God or his or her faith very often. I believe faith is when you do the best you can, do what is right for others and believe and pray that everything will be ok. I believe the President should have a good relationship with God because if they don't believe in something they will fall for anything.\", 'I had a conversation with 2 ladies from my church when we were doing our weekly volunteer work at the food bank. All 3 of us agreed that the tone for this presidential election was acidic and pathetic, and did not represent the views of all of America. While faith is important for a candidate to have, we all agreed that it would not be the one final decision factor to support a candidate. There are too many important issues in this country, that need decisions made, and a candidate needs to have more than just a faith quality. The reason being that a President has to have the capacity to make very tough judgement calls, and while he may be able to rely on his faith to make those decisions, he needs to also have leadership and compassion to make really tough decisions that may be out of his faith comfort zone.', \"I had a discussion with my neighbor who is also a stay at home mother. She is along the same lines as myself that whoever wins this election isn't going to be the best fit in regards to fixing the country because they both portray some scary elements at times. She told me that she plans on voting for the third party candidate like her husband. I tried to explain to her that that candidate doesn't stand a chance against the electoral college and voting for him would be essentially voting for Hillary, who we both agree is the worst of both candidates. I don't think I was able to persuade her vote though. Since we belong to the same faith it really didn't play a role in our conversation since we agree on the mainstream issues such as abortion, the Mexican Wall and the transgender issue. [I understand both your positions on the candidates, but if the candidates were to have the same views on the issues you stated, but did not necessarily share the same faith or religion as you, how would that play into who you support?] Oh, sorry! As long as the candidate has the same views as I mentioned neither myself or my neighbor would have an issue with their faith/religion. I feel my issues correlate with faith so I'd be assuming that the candidate would belong to the same faith if not at least believe in the same God. But if they did believe in a different God and support my causes besides being strange I wouldn't judge them for practicing freely because it would just be a contradiction of my own belief.\", \"My conversation was with my husband whose faith and political views are similar to mine.  He didn't seem to be quite as offended by the tone of the election as I have been.  The fact that the two major parties are almost polar opposites on their views breeds contempt.  My husband feels like the civil disrespect we have seen is normal at this point in an election.  One point he did make was that the bullying and name calling wasn't necessary.  He and I totally agree on this point. Faith did not play a factor in our discussion, per se.  We did discuss whether excluding/targeting select groups would be the Christian thing to do and agreed that it would not be.  However, both agreed that there has to be a vetting process to protect our country from those who would do us harm.  Making a blanket statement to exclude a specific ethnic group from entering our country is stereotyping and a few bad apples don't ruin the whole basket. [Why do you believe your husband has not been as offended by the tone of the election compared to you? I understand you and your husband's position on immigration and if a candidate made drastic measures on immigration, such as Trump, and it made the country safer would you still consider that candidate Christian or not?] My husband feels like our country needs to address some key issues and that calm discussions haven't produced results.  He feels like we need to get mad at this point in order for change to happen and Trump is definitely mad.    Personally, I try not to mix religion and politics.  There are men/women who don't consider themselves Christian but they are good people and strive for a safe, prosperous country.  I have many non-Christian friends who I love and trust.  Some have differing political views but some have the same.  The key is that we can discuss our commonalities as well as our differences in a civil manner and still remain friends.    As far as considering one a Christian if they result to drastic measures to stop or slow immigration, I am reminded of the old WWJD acronym.  What would Jesus do?  Would he turn away those in greatest need?  I don't think so.  However, one must be able to discern truth from those who would manipulate.  I am a Christian but I am not voting for a candidate because of their religion or their faith.  I am voting for the candidate who will get our country back on track and grow our economy.  I'm voting for the candidate who will lay the groundwork for my grandchildren.  I don't believe Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton will be the one to accomplish these tasks.\", \"I had this conversation with my mother, who is Catholic. She sees the tone of the election negative and unruly. The discussion did involve the idea of faith. We discussed how both candidates are really not the best for the job overall, and for her, her faith and what her values are and beliefs are, are causing her to not want to even vote in the election. She doesn't feel like her vote would make a difference because they are both bad candidates in the first place. She feels that Hillary is way too far one way and Trump is way to uncensored. The discussion focused on more why she didn't like the candidates and how it has gotten so worse over the years with all the crap they pull. She said she just wishes that there would be elections without all the crap and mudslinging between candidates and false promises or loud mouths. It then led to a discussion between the both of us discussing how even local politics is corrupt and that all the corruption in the world and the US in general from local to presidency is all corrupt and people get bought out. She then commented on Hillary's emails and that the FBI decided not to prosecute. She thought that was ridiculous because of morality, which I agreed. [I understand your mother's position, and I am curious as to why she believes it is ridiculous that Clinton was not prosecuted by the FBI based on morality? If a candidate had high morals, but not necessarily the same faith/beliefs/religion as your mother, do you believe she would be willing to vote? What would inspire your mother to participate in voting in the election?] She thinks that anyone else would have been prosecuted but she was a First Lady and is now candidate so they are protecting her perhaps. If they had high morals yes. Even if they disagreed on some things. High morals are important. She said a candidate with high morals because she doesn't see any right now.\", 'I spoke with my husband and he and I see eye to eye with this whole campaign/election. He believes Mr. Trump has been very uncivil throughout, lots of name calling, lies and being downright mean. He also said that he found Mrs. Clinton\\'s campaign to be very arrogant, anyone who disagrees with her on an issue must be an idiot. My husband also does not plan to vote for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. Our faith didn\\'t play a huge roll in this particular conversation. Though I know our faith has led us to believe we cannot support either candidate from a moral standpoint. Just today my husband quoted C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity) in reference to being unable to support either candidate. \"I feel a strong desire to tell you--and I expect you feel a strong desire to tell me--which of these two errors is the worse. That is the devil getting at us. He always sends errors into the world in pairs--pairs of opposites. And he always encourages us to spend a lot of time thinking about which is the worse. You see why, of course? He relies on your extra dislike of the one error to draw you gradually into the opposite one. But do not let us be fooled. We have to keep our eyes on the goal and go straight through between both errors. We have no other concern than that with either of them.\"', \"I had a conversation with my boyfriend.  The election frightens them.  They feel that this is another case of choosing the better of two evils.  They feel that neither of the candidates is honest or has the interests of America at heart.  Both candidates seem snide and looking to get the biggest reactions out of their statements rather than actually contribute possible solutions or political ideas.  I asked him about how his faith came into consideration and he mentioned that if he had to pick one he would vote for Hillary because Trump's extremism and seeming belief that he should control everyone's choices for the good of white people who believe they should control everything is terrifying.  But he did mention that Hillary's actions and words do not exactly show her as a compassionate candidate who understands what is it to be an average American citizen either.\", 'I spoke to my neighbor who is very religious.  She said she was very concerned about the election.  She feels Donald Trump is not a Christian and said she would only vote for a Christian.  Her family is very hard core.  I told her that I felt that the country has more important things to worry about than if a candidate is a Christian.  I said there are good and bad in all religions and good and bad in people who do not have any religious beliefs.  She started quoting the bible so I was done.  You cannot have a debate with some people who have such strong beliefs.', 'I had a conversation with a man I know. He is very intelligent and has been following the election closely. He said he was very disappointed in the tone of the campaign because there is so much insulting going on back and forth between the candidates rather than more concern about the country and the issues being the main focus. His response to religion playing a role was \"we are one nation under God.\" I don\\'t believe he is very religious and I am not myself.', 'Conversation with my sister in law. She views the tone of election as part of the way of society is becoming more ugly///more hateful with disagreement. Less kindness. Her faith reflects her choice; democratic party appears more obligated to fellow man. (Hillary is not her first choice, but essentially her only choice now).', \"I had a conversation with my husband.  He saw the tone of the campaign as being combative, cantankerous and petty. We both believe that faith had nothing to do with the views that both of us hold. We both think that the candidates should be discussing policy in civil manner and that the issue of religion has taken a back seat. Issues like abortion, gay rights and the family seem to put on the back burner.  What is on the forefront is immigration, terrorism and jobs. These are major issues that I want addressed but at the same time I also want equal rights for the lgbtq communities and the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body. Perhaps we feel that the conversations among the candidates have not been appropriate at times because we both possess a value system that frowns upon the lack of decorum between the leading contenders. [What would you and your husband need to hear or relate to from the candidates to feel they possess the value system you believe they are lacking? I understand you believe specific issues of religion have taken a back seat, why is that? How do you see a way to bring this issues forward and have conversations about them in a way that possess the value system you mentioned?] First of all, I would like the most recent announcements involving Hillary Clinton 's issues with her email fraud to be addressed directly by her.  She has not responded to the justice' dept's findings. As of yesterday the state dept is reopening the case. I distrust her even though I find her to be the more professionally presenting & diplomatic candidate. I need to hear her relate to the American public on the issue of honesty, scruples and disclosure.  Even if she apologized and admitted a mistake and moved on from there that would more reassuring to me. She may have addressed this in such a long drawn out saga of dealing with this issue but I feel she needs to settle the issue perhaps in a 1-1 interview with a news person or religious leader. I just find that there is an aura of deception and 'back door deals' that surround both her husband and her.  Frankly, there are aspects of Bill Clinton that I admire. He is a charismatic individual that did a lot of good for our country despite his private downfalls.  As for Trump, I think that he needs to speak more about his faith as a man and how this will help him lead our country into change. I think that he needs to explain his value system if he has one and how he will make our nation greater through policies that he will make. I believe that he needs to speak more about he has raised his family, built a business and cares about people in a more practical, gentler tone that makes sense to those who are unsure of voting for him. I think we need to see another side of him to reassure us that he can handle criticism, major decisions and diplomacy.  Religious related issues are secondary to me at this point.  Economic/job related issues, national security/terrorism handling, immigration reform along with proper handling of human rites and health care are paramount to me. Secondary are issues that relate to pro-choice/pro-life decisions, lgtbq rites, stem cell research, etc.  These certainly are human issues that need to be discussed and clarified so I would like to hear his stand on these things perhaps in a 1-1 interview too. Politicians flip flop on so many things and I understand that people can change their views as they learn more about a topic. I think I would like a civil discussion that is held in a professional manner allowing each to voice their opinions without tearing each other apart and that is why I think such interviews should be done separately.\", 'I talked to my neighbor and we had a very good long talk about the election and how she has chosen not to vote in the upcoming election. My friend Alice thinks that neither candidate has a \"good moral compass\" and that she thinks both are as far from being religious as one can get. I have to admit neither one of us knew what religion either candidate belongs to. We both agreed that Trump is to much of a wild card and we do not like to watch or listen to what he has to say because of his foul mouth or as she says \"potty mouth\" and we both agreed that Hilary is running a cleaner campaign. We both like the stance that Trump has on abortion but were not sure what else he stands for. It was an interesting conversation but we both are glad that religion has not muddied the water of this already strange election. [I understand you both believe that religion has not muddied the water in this election, and I wish to ask why you both believe this? Using your term, what issues have muddied the water among candidates?] Both candidates do not speak about religion much or at all from what both my neighbor and I have seen or heard but I have not been keeping up much on the campaign the last couple of weeks. Both my neighbor and I feel that both candidates do their fair share of name calling and bring up negative issues like Clinton and her emails and not being charged and Trump and his investment school or Trump not showing his tax returns or Clinton and Benghazi. Doesn\\'t seem like either candidate talks about the family unit, moral values and how they would stop the killing of each other.', 'I had a conversation with my Mother. She feels the tone of the election is pretty fair. She thinks Trumps ideals are pretty racist and harsh but feels most of America wants drastic change. My Mom and I believe in having equality and that everyone deserves a chance to live with the right to do what is morally best. She feels our nation has started to lose sight of what is best for us as a nation and that we need to start looking at a bigger picture.', 'I had a conversation with an associate pastor at my church, how I had known for many years.  I knew that we had similar viewpoints, and despite that, he had a well-known history of being open-minded. That being said, in his politically active life (some 15 years more than me), this is the first election cycle in a long time that he was actually worried about.  With fiery rhetoric and mass public protests and rioting, he said that this time in our country\\'s history will be one of the most volatile on record. Being members of the same church, we discussed the matter in a faith-based context.  We were both in agreement that a sort of divine intervention will need to take place to keep the country from falling into chaos.  I tend to take a more direct approach to daily living, where he more strongly believes that God plays an ongoing and active daily role in the lives of humanity.  While I tend to believe that the United States will be allowed to fall into an unrecognizable state, he tends to think that something will happen that will cause a resurgence of religious activity in the country, \"righting the ship,\" so to speak.  I hope he is right. [If you can, could you elaborate on what you both mean of a \"divine intervention?\" What would that look like? I understand you both have opposing looks on the country, but what makes you believe the country will fall into an \"unrecognizable state?\"] Sure!  What I understood was that the \"divine intervention\" that he spoke about would be an event that could have no other explanation other than the hand of God.  I am scared to think of how this may manifest, but I am hoping that this will be for the good of our country.    I think that, up to this point, how he and I view the history of the United States would have been fairly congruent, albeit that his life experience may have shaped his opinion more than my academic view of the relative past.  My biggest concern is that neither of the candidates that are up for election this cycle have the favor of any big part of the populace, and so despite who wins, and by how much, there is going to be an uprising that will create massive civil unrest.  This could fundamentally change the social structure in the US.  I think this, and the avoidance of it, is where the pastor is going to be looking for the \"divine intervention\" that he was speaking about. (Male)', 'I had a conversation last night with my boyfriend, Jamie. Him and I share a similar view on the presidential election. We view it as manipulative and a joke. Neither of us are fans of Trump or Hillary, but if given the choice we both agreed Hillary would be a better choice out of the two. Faith played a minor role in our discussion, mostly because we both believe the president should be about the countries needs not for the needs of a certain faith. We also agreed that along with our faith it is said to treat people with respect and decency, to love your fellow man, and to not cast stones. (Female)', 'I had this conversation with my mother, and she saw the tone of the presidential election as a mud-slinging contest \"as it always is\". My mother is religious as well, so we were able to talk about faith in the election. She said she would very much prefer a candidate who possesses Christian morals and has a track record of doing so (as opposed to just saying they attend church, for example). [What kind of track record would your mother need to see or hear to feel that an individual possesses Christian morals? What if the candidate was not of Christian faith?] She would need to see that he or she has voted with Christian values (if any political experience), such as pro-life, etc. If the candidate was not of a Christian faith, my mother would have a difficult time voting for him or her. (Male)', 'I actually talked with my boyfriend. It was interesting, because it was something that we had never talked about before. He thinks that the tone of the election is interesting, but not in the least bit civil. Our faith did not play a role, but only because we were looking at the big Picture. Both candidates are doing inexcusable things, but at least Trump is out in the open about it. We talked about the fact that religious groups are being attacked, and we both took the stance that something needs to be done about it. No matter who wins. (Female)', \"I had a conversation with a male friend of mine that I attended seminary with. He is conservative, but not partisan by any means. I think he's an Independent. I don't think he's registered with any party. Anyway, he sees the tone of the presidential election as rude and cutthroat, probably more so than ever. He thinks that both Trump and Clinton are uncivil. He was especially horrified by Trump's attitude towards Muslims. He clearly identified Trump as the more uncivil candidate (I agreed). I think faith played a role largely in the sense that our faith is what guides our moral outlook on life and on situations such as this. We talked about that being about it in terms of how faith affects our political decisions though. (Female)\", \"I had a conversation with my 93-year-old grandmother regarding the presidential election. She is a devout Christian, although at times her beliefs descent from what other Christians may view as the correct answer. My grandmother views the tone of the election as somewhat of a circus; she notes that either side is guilty of mudslinging, and that both sides play dirty and take cheap shots at one another. Faith plays a part in her decisions, insofar as she believes that we are all God's children; we shouldn't necessarily be judged in terms of our religion or race, but at the same time, she understands the desire for wanting to keep the nation safe from extremist individuals. (Male)\", 'I had a conversation with a good friend of mine, Wendy. She is in her 50\\'s and is of course a person of faith. She seemed to feel that the tone of the election is about the same as any other election in the past. She said that all the personal attacks and controversial topics present is what one should expect any election year. To me she seemed to think nothing wrong with the tone of the election but, to be fair, she does not follow the campaigns very closely nor does she watch tv. All she is basing her stance on is articles read online and conversations with her friends and family. I personally did not think that my faith or her played too big of a role in the whole conversation but, I did directly ask her if her faith had any say in how she felt about this election. She stated only that her faith in God has shown her that voting for Donald Trump is \"the right thing to do\". I am really not sure why she is basing it on not too many facts and just feeling but, that\\'s what she said. (Male)', 'I spoke with my mother about this topic. She sees the tone of the campaigns having a sense of urgency or desperation. When asked about the civility of the campaigns, she responded in saying that \"no, it has not been civil. But then again, in all my years I\\'ve never seen a civil campaign. They are always hostile\". Haha almost every conversation I ever have with my mother is affected by our faith. As important as faith is to me in politics it is even more important to her. She is convinced that Hilary is a terrible person, and believes that anyone is better than her. Although she doesn\\'t love Trump in every way, she believes that he is at least a man of faith, and thus will be voting for him. (Male)', \"I had my conversation with my father, who is an Evangelical Christian. He stated that he thought the tone of the election was negative overall. My father supports Trump over Clinton, but he expressed a definite distaste for Trump's loudmouthed antics. When asked about the level of influence that his faith has over his decision-making process, he stated that the only area that he feels that his faith influences him is the issue of abortion. He did say, however, that he feels that stopping abortion from occurring is a losing battle, and therefore it doesn't carry much weight in his choosing a candidate. He said that what's most important to him in choosing a candidate is whether the individual will likely uphold the Constitution, and that his faith does not influence this notion very much. (Male)\", 'I had the conversation with my mom. She shared that the tone of the presidential election was like the candidates were always one-upping each other, like the tone was implying that it’s a popularity contest. She furthermore conceded that when she was a young adult the campaigns had their fair share of mudslinging. But this presidential election has had an unprecedented social media eruption of chaos and negativity. Faith had an afterthought appeal, kind of \"Oh and by the way, I wish my faith and morals were being represented. The president needs to be a strong moral leader and that just isn\\'t happening.\" [I understand your mother\\'s reflection of past and present elections and appreciate her insights. I am curious as what you mother believes represents a strong moral leader?] I understand my mother\\'s beliefs according to Christian biblical teachings that a person of strong character will be above reproach, that a strong moral leader will be careful and intentional in their behavior so that their lifestyle reflects their convictions, and that if they falter they are humble enough to admit their mistakes and seek wise counsel. (Female)', 'I spoke with Megan Moore, my coworker. She has a similar viewpoint to mine to politics in general. We have different faith but she also sees how many politicians are not very civil, especially Donald Trump. She expressed her feelings against him and how she dislikes his way of living life. She said faith is irrelevant for politicians because it is just a front that they put on. She doesn\\'t believe that they can have true faith. I was incredibly surprised to hear her response and how similar it was to mine. I felt encouraged as my opinions are often unique. [I understand Megan\\'s position, and I am curious to understand what you mean by having true faith? If you both believe that a candidate cannot have true faith, what guides your decision about who to support? How does the candidate\\'s religion affect your decision?] I can\\'t remember her exact words but I remember she said politics and faith can\\'t go together or be used to influence each other. Basically her faith is completely separate from politics and she does not use it as a judgement criterion. I agree because they cannot have \"true faith\": James 2:14-19 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. Faith of the candidate does not affect our decisions because these candidates seem to me like the demons here, only believing in one God but not having any deeds. This verse was selected by me but I would imagine Megan agreeing. The only way that faith would affect our decision is if the candidate actually had faith, which I have never seen or can imagine seeing in the future. The one that came closest was probably Ronald Reagan but at the same time his faith was in a church not God. The church he attended (Catholic church) has numerous church leaders that molest little children as if it is nothing.  Our decisions are guided by logic and understanding of the governmental system as a whole. We choose a candidate based upon how much they might benefit our families with their political decisions. It may be important to mention that we both work at a law firm. We are both dissatisfied with the current candidates, as well as those who took part in the primaries. (Male)', 'I had a conversation with my younger brother who will be a freshman in high school this coming year. He said in his friend group and the little he sees on the news he thinks there is a generally negative tone from both parties in all assets of the election. In his eyes he felt like most of it almost seemed like a joke. He is obviously a little younger than myself, but from a faith standpoint he basically said, \"I don\\'t think either of them have much real faith, so I would probably pick the lesser of two evils and vote for Trump if I were old enough.\" Obviously we come from the same household, but I was still intrigued at how similar our thoughts were on the issue. (Male)', \"I had the conversation with my friend Chris who is a person of strong faith. He believed the tone of the campaign to be hostile. He felt Donald Trump's tone was very combative and Clinton's tone comes across to him as corrupt and dishonest. He expressed to me that while he is a person of faith, he does not feel the president absolutely has to be. He indicated that as long as they are honest and true to their beliefs, he would trust them. [I understand Chris' position that the president does not have to be a person of faith. Does this also apply to the religion the president practices?] I think it doesn't. I think the president can have a religious practice and keep it separate from the presidency.  (Female)\", \"I chose to talk to my best friend Jessica. She is a Lutheran just like me and attends church about once a month, but grew up going almost every weekend. However, she is incredibly liberal in her beliefs which isn't always the case with Christians. Her husband owns a gun shop so that leads her to be a bit conservative in certain areas. She basically thinks that Trump is a complete jerk and that Clinton would make a much better president. She agreed, though, that she would rather have neither of them become president. Faith played much less of a role in her opinions than I thought it would. She really doesn't even take that into consideration when voting. As stated above, she's almost completely liberal. [I understand Jessica's position; did she go into further detail as to why would not want Clinton as president even though she believes Clinton to be the better choice? What made you think that Jessica would let faith play a larger role in her opinions? Why do you believe there is a correlation between being liberal and how much someone lets faith factor into their opinion?] She didn't go into much detail about Clinton. I'm used to hearing from pretty much everyone I know that neither of the candidates are ideal so I didn't really ask why not considering I'm just so adapted to hearing that now. Strong liberals like Jess tend to take pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage to an extreme. While I support both of those to a certain extent it definitely does conflict with what we are taught in the Bible. That's the biggest reason I usually associate faith with being more conservative. (Female)\", \"I talked to my mother and she has similar doubts about our candidates. She believes Trump would be far better then Clinton because of some prophecies she has heard. I do believe God can use anyone. She gets so mad listening to Hillary lie her way out of trouble. She sees the tone as very hostile. Faith has to guide our decisions as Christians it's our duty to try to support people who can make the world better. [I understand your mother's position, but could you elaborate on the prophecies she has heard?] My mother reads things from the Elijah list online. This is a link from a prophecy that they had on their site for a while. https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=2016+presidential+prophecies&&view=detail&mid=B91B0FCF1D430A3EA945B91B0FCF1D430A3EA945&rvsmid=CA1884FA25CA5D0EDC32CA1884FA25CA5D0EDC32&fsscr=-3960&FORM=VDFSRV\", \"My husband Rob. He sees the tone just about normal (a lot of name calling and stupid comments mostly from Trump or Trump supporters) for today's climate. Well Rob and his family are Catholic and were always democrats and traditionally voted democrat. He is registered democrat but tells me he votes his conscience. He does not tell me who he actually votes for but I am guessing we cancel out each other's vote from time to time. My family is all Protestant but my parents were registered democrats just so they could vote in local elections and primaries where there were mostly democrats while they tended to hold conservative Christian views. I am registered republican and usually vote republican but I have voted democrat from time to time, just not recently. The primary topic of our conversation is how can we as faithful Christians vote for Hillary or Trump? Rob is pro-life but said that he was taught in seminary not to make a choice for a candidate on just one issue. I said I understand that in concept, but I can't feel good about putting Hillary in office because of her support of abortion for anyone who wants one. Robs view is that I am too narrow in this thinking. His family is also military (marine) so I think he is mindful of Hillary’s experience abroad as sec state. I see her as dishonest and deceitful and basically a person who misrepresents on a major scale and when caught, still got out of situation so I can only imagine bribery or blackmail was involved. My faith and Robs faith are strong and sincere, but it seems we have to discern our choice to vote differently. We can't really judge either candidate as a Christian because neither really is one. So all we can do is judge them by what they are whether it be lawyer, businessman, diplomat or real estate developer or former First Lady. Do you judge a quarterback by his faith or his touchdowns? Touchdowns of course! We basically agree to disagree.\", 'Good morning!!!! I had a conversation with my friend who lives a couple house\\'s away. It started good. She is a straight trump supported. She likes the fact he is going to a \"\"wall\\'\\' which we had a debate on how this would be done or even be affective. Then we talked about abortion. Where she thinks it’s not up to women it is murder. Now I had in the past felt if you couldn\\'t afford or were in a bad way, drugs, abusive relationships, homeless, or just couldn\\'t afford a child it was okay. Now after having 6 kids and as of yesterday at 7 pm 9 grandchild I feel if the child was conceived as a result of rape or the mother or child we in physical danger and it’s before 14 weeks its Owe were both at a disagreement. On her being of Jewish decent and I myself being catholic she was saying your catholic you don\\'t believe in abortion. As many Catholics are pro-life it’s not a deal breaker being a catholic. [It seems that the topic of abortion is important to you and your friend. May I clarify that if the candidate was Catholic that would not be an issue or is their position on abortion more important? What if the candidate was another faith or religion?] Their beliefs in religion have no bearing on my vote.       It’s about their stance on things. Immigration is a very big thing as is national security.       We were speaking more on abortion because of the fact I have 6 Children, and now 9 grandchildren. She was saying typical catholic upbringing that\\'s how we got our the subject. Lol...Thank you so much on my grandson...', \"I talked to my best friend. She and I took our children and voted together in the election 8 years ago, when my youngest was 3 months old! She does not see this election as good, considering the 2 who are options. She prays God will take mercy on us. Our choices are about as far from godly as possible, so all we can do is have faith. She pointed out how far we have fallen away from God since Bill Clinton was in office. Yes, sin has always been rampant in politics, but it was always kept hidden. To have our president have an affair and then lie about it was awful, but we as a country turned the other way. She says that was when we as a country started to really justify our sin. We both think it is a shame that there are good people who would be wonderful leaders, but they won't get the chance because of that fact. This country does not seem to want godly and wise leadership.\", 'My husband. He sees the tone of this election as very bad. His faith plays an active role in who he votes for, but for the past several elections it has been more a voting for \"the lessor of 2 evils\". I agree with him, I don\\'t really want to vote for any of the candidates since none stand for what I believe, so I also choose the lessor of 2 evils.', \"Most of my friends are Jehovah's Witnesses. At least the ones of faith are. As you may or may not know, Jehovah's Witnesses do not take part in any political activity. They like to see themselves as no part of this world. I did try to speak with a friend but she professed to be unconcerned and not interested in the current political goings on. Now, I believe that in fact she does pay some attention to what is going on but she won't admit that because to do so would be to admit that she is not being obedient to the leaders of her faith. So there was not too much of a conversation as I'm sure you can imagine.\", \"I talked to my husband about the election, we both agreed that the tone of the election wasn't what we would call civil, and it felt like the candidates were working harder to tear one another down than to lift themselves up. He said he doesn't really focus on the campaign itself from a faith based perspective, if he knew outright that a candidate did not believe in God or followed a religion that was vastly different from his own (examples mentioned were, Jehovah Witness, Mormon, Muslim) he would be far less inclined to vote for that person. [Why does your husband feel less inclined to vote for a person who believed or followed a religion vastly different from his? How vast would it have to be?] The three religions he mentioned were Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormon, and Muslim.  He said that he felt they might have different priorities and a different moral compass than he would want in a leader.\", \"I had a discussion with my husband about this. I had wanted to discuss it with someone else, but I've had to work a lot of overtime at work. He expressed that he thought the tone of the presidential candidates was unprofessional, and agreed with my assessment when I said I thought the tone was combative. In discussing what we thought of the tone of the candidates, our faith did not come up.\", 'I had a conversation with a close friend from church and from my life group at church.  We had discussed politics earlier in the year during the primaries, but had not discussed the presidential election in several months. She is not pleased with the candidates that are left after the primaries and sees the tone of the election as this point as not civil and rather unprofessional.  She deems the office of President as a position that is worthy of respect and honor and feels the current candidates lack these qualities and do not give the position respect.  We did discuss faith and how it shapes our views regarding our role in society in regards to voting and what God\\'s word says about it.  We also discussed other well-known Christians who have shared their views on the election and whether we agreed with them or how we disagreed.  We discussed how the election of either main candidate could affect our lives and would affect the country in the coming years.  Our faith is who we are so of course it played a role as we evaluated both candidates and how we felt these candidates would govern in regards to our faith. [Could you elaborate on how your faith will play a role in evaluating the candidates and what would it take for you to support a candidate? What were the views of the other well-known Christians you spoke of?] Our faith played a role in evaluating the candidates by using Scripture to discuss immature Christians vs. mature Christians vs. cultural \"Christians\". Cultural Christians is a term she uses to describe someone who professes they are a Christian but it seems unsure whether they have a true saving faith in Jesus. This is seen a lot here in the South/Bible belt where almost everyone says they are a Christian but not all demonstrate characteristics described by the Bible of a Christian. We discussed how it can be convenient for politicians/candidates to identify with Christianity but do their actions, words, votes on legislation align with God\\'s Word. She and I describe immature Christians as those who are new to a relationship with Jesus Christ or have not matured in their faith since receiving Christ as their Lord and Savior. Mature Christians are those who do demonstrate growth and sanctification and also demonstrate fruit from their relationship with Jesus as described in Matthew 7:10 \"Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\" and Colossians 1: 10 \"so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,\". This is how our faith is being used to evaluate the candidates as guided by our faith in the work of Jesus and the Word of God.   The views of other well-known Christians have discussed the possibility that Trump may be an immature Christian. Some well-known Christians spoke out strongly against him in the primaries but have been quiet since he is now the Republican nominee. Other Christians have supported him from early on in the primary and have stated they are voting for a President not voting on the basis of Christianity. It will be interesting to see how these views evolve as we move forward in the election season.   ****I answered this earlier today but put it in the wrong spot as a blog post.  See above.  I apologize!', \"My friend patty she is a chaplain. She thought it was out of control.  The lies, hatred. Yes, her faith says they don’t get too involved in politics or war as she is Mennonite.  She also said if trump claims to be Christian she won’t call him a liar.  And lots of people say they are and act the same way.  She thinks Hillary is a liar. she doesn’t like or agree with trumps views behavior or hatred.  She doesn't believe in violence and trump encourages violence. [Why would she not call Trump a liar if he says he is a Cristian and what makes her believe Clinton is a liar?] Um I think what I meant to say is she might not believe he’s a Christian but she won’t call him a liar for that since she doesn’t believe in saying someone anyone is lying regarding their faith.  She said a lot of people claim to be of faith but their behavior and actions show different.  She said who am I to say they are regarding their faith.  She thinks Hillary is a lair bout ethics not about her faith.\", \"I visited with my mother about the upcoming election. She's very disappointed by the quality of the two candidates and sees the tone of the election as unpleasant. Neither candidate fits in with her beliefs or ideals. I believe her faith leads her to expect moral behavior from others as she would expect from those around her. Her faith leads her to disagree, like I do, about Donald Trump's comments about refusing Muslim immigrants. As part of an older generation whose faith teaches them, she disagrees with same sex marriages which is of course a political and social hot button. In that way, her faith definitely influences her political beliefs. Also of topic was the funding of Planned Parenthood and the legalities of abortions. In this way, our conversation was swayed by her religious beliefs that influence her political leanings.\", \"I had a conversation with two people a friend and a workplace acquaintance. They were in agreement that the tone of the presidential election especially in the last week that it is full of vitriol and out of control rage. And it is disconcerting. We talked about that internal barometer that a persons of faith can rely on as an anchor of sorts. we said that faith is sorely missing and is much needed faith tolerance and respect. [I understand you all believe that faith is missing from this election, and I wish to ask what everyone would need to hear or relate to from the candidates to be reassured that they possess faith, tolerance, and respect? If the candidates can demonstrate these qualities, would they have to parallel your own personal beliefs or do they just need to possess them? How do they feel religion plays a part?] This is the second time I'm responding to this follow up question so sure hope it posts this time :) no the candidates don't have to mirror my own personal religious beliefs however it is important to me that they exhibit a measure of faith and demonist such .... I personally believe faith serves as an anchor and although our democracy is based on freedom to practice any religion you desire it's important to me they at although they don't practice publicly that they process these attributes internally and embrace faith based morals\", 'I had a conversation with 2 of my friends about the candidates. They also think that Trumps re-tweets things from the supremacists and neo-Nazis.  They also feel that he is running a dirty campaign, by bashing Clinton whenever he can. They are also pro-Israel. Our faith never was discussed. [I understand they are pro-Israel, did your friends express how being pro-Israel impacts who they are supporting?] Yes because of our faith.  Since the people of Israel are the chosen ones.', 'I had a conversation with my 20-year-old son. He sees the tone of the presidential election as \"sad\" and \"scary.\" His sentiments pretty much mirror my own - he doesn\\'t necessarily think Trump is honest and refined enough for the job, but knows for a fact that the depth of Clinton\\'s lies are incomparable to the point where she is unelectable. His faith plays a huge role in the way he lives day-to-day, so his words are spoken from the heart and with love. His faith, like mine, leads him to think an honest and sincere candidate like Ted Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson or even Rick Santorum would have been so much better.', \"my neighbor Judy and I talk a lot about the country and the presidential election. She lives a few doors down from me and is a person of faith. She happens to agree with a lot of my believes. We are both sick of the way the country is headed and with the government that has been running it. Neither one of us considered faith in our decision. We are both more concerned with getting someone into office that isn't afraid to fight back against all the evil coming our way. [What evil do you and your friend believe is coming to the United States? How do you believe Trump or Clinton will deal with those evils and why one candidate is better than the other?] I think Donald Trump will be tougher on the terrorists. Hillary is going to owe other countries to many favors because she has been accepting donations from them. she is all for letting anyone into this country before we have a solid plan to screen them. we let to many evil people into this country. I think Donald Trump would protect us more so than Hillary. I've listened to a lot of the debates and speeches and Hillary keeps changing her position on many of her views. she takes money from countries that are cruel to their woman but says she is for woman's rights. when I say evil I am talking about people wanting to harm us just because we are American's.\", ' you are probably aware, Donald Trump has become the Republican nominee for President. Regardless of whether you support him, we are hoping to get some of your initial impressions about Donald Trump.  How do you think you will be personally affected if Donald Trump wins the Presidency?  Please tell us your thinking or reasons for your answer.  What are the biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency? What are the biggest risks of a Trump Presidency? Donald Trump describes himself as a Christian. o   Do you see Trump as a Christian?', \"I don't know that I will personally affected if he becomes president. but I don't think he would be a good leader for our country. I think he will be tougher on illegal immigration, which I do agree with. But I think he will offend a lot of other countries with his brass personality. I also think he is a little too cocky and will try to make too big of changes to things without thinking them all the way thru. I don't think that he acts like Christians are supposed to act. especially with all the name calling he does to others. [Why do you believe you will not be affected if Trump becomes president? How are Christians supposed to act in your opinion and do you believe Trump needs to act that way if he is president?] Christians should try to be respectful of people. and Trump definitely is not. he basically disrespects everyone from immigrants to women and the disabled\", \"I think one of the benefits of having him as a president is his knowledge of big business. He knows how to make money and, somehow, win people over.   I don't understand it, but some people seem to like his style and respect him. The biggest risk is his outspoken way of dealing with people. He says whatever he wants and is not one to be diplomatic. I don't see him as being very religious.\", \"First of I thought why not trump. He is a business man and maybe that’s what this country needs for a change instead of a lying politician so forctaht I think it would be good The prob with trump is he speaks his mind a little too much and other countries will look at him as a joke I’m not sure how Christian he is He does seem to talk a lot of bad about the other candidates. [Does your uncertainty of Trump's Christian values have an impact on your impressions of him?] I guess in a way they do. He does name call and bully which turns me off of thinking him as our country’s leader He does need to act a little more Christian. [In what ways does Trump need to act more Christian?] His words are very harsh He speaks without worrying about who he offends His words against a lot of people are offending He needs to be more respectful He may not like how some people act or look but he doesn’t need to openly put them down We all have our own opinions about people but keep them to yourself Stop badmouthing people openly\", \"I think my taxes I pay will go up because he seems to only be concerned about the rich staying rich. I am in the middle class and I don't think he has my best interests at heart. I also think I will have to pay more for my health insurance because he will get rid of Obamacare. I think Obamacare has reduced the price we all pay for health insurance. The biggest benefit of Trump Being President is that there will be much less illegal immigration. That will be an improvement because the resources will not have to be spent as much on people not paying taxes. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency is that he is a one man show and will not take kindly to others in his camp giving him advice if he does not agree with them. Also, other World Leaders will not respect Trump and may turn against that US. I do not see Trump as a Christian because he does not seem to be willing to help others as Christ wants us to.\", \"I think Donald Trump is a better candidate for presidency then Hillary even though he scares me as well. I don't think much will change for me personally if he becomes the president. I see him in the beginning focusing his attention on what he can handle best which is running a business and expanding. I don't think he'll focus too much on foreign policies first. I think if he wins he's going to focus on bringing back jobs to America that were before sent overseas which would be great if it could actually happen. I'm hoping with his business expertise that he'll tackle the horrible limitations Obama put on small business owners and if anything helps reverse his orders and instill ones that will help grow the small business economy. Another benefit I'm hoping he'll bring to the table is a better method of border watching between us and Mexico. There are just too many stories to share about how scary it can be living so close to the border, which I still have family that does. I would hope he'd start with something else that Obama took away which is Border Patrol financial budgets and staffing. I think Trump will work with the Border Patrol agencies in developing their skills further to help them succeed in keeping the borders safe. A big risk I have with Trump becoming president is his lack of compassion. I don't know how much of this is an act to get covered by the media more, in regards to his blunt remarks but it really does come across that he only cares about his agendas and if you can't per-sway his ideals then it's a lost cause. Also it's been so long since we've had a non-politician in office and although that idea excites me it also terrifies me in is he capable enough to handle foreign leaders. Also I think during his campaign he is making a lot of enemies so assassination could also be a factor with his bold ideas. I don't really see the term Christian as something it once stood for so if Trump describes himself as one just go for it like everyone else does. It saddens me that so many people claim to be Christians but that have never picked up a Bible or even know who Jesus really was. They just know hey this guy Jesus a lot of people claim him as their God so I guess I will too, without ever knowing what he went through. So many people nowadays claim the term Christian but then go ahead and pick what things out of the Bible they want to believe and ignore the rest as if it doesn't exist. Some Christians don't even recognize valid books of the Bible and exclude them in their teachings. Unfortunately, Christianity is getting more and more divided then it ever should have. So I really don't take offense to people who call themselves Christians because I'll believe it in their actions versus their words. So far Trump displays acts of Christianity such as when he donated a lot of money to the veterans during one of his campaign runs.\", \"I think that it will personally affect me when I visit a hospital for care because he will do away with Obamacare. If I need to visit a hospital I will not have to wait because all the rooms won't be full with people who don't need to be there, but go anyways because of the healthcare for everyone currently. My life would directly improve. The biggest benefits of his presidency includes no more Obamacare, a complete different direction for the country which we need, less illegal immigration using our benefits for free when he have homeless people, and putting our needs first. The biggest risks include if we have a relationship with North Korea, will other countries see that as treason? Will his candid mouth get him into trouble with our allies? I see him as a Christian because he does want good for this country. He wants to make the country better by making our own things, thus creating jobs. He wants us to stop helping others who should be secondary to the list when our own people should be put first like our homeless. We have spent so much resources and money helping other countries when we have people starving here and homeless. The reason he is so passionate about his ideas is because he values America and the citizens.\", 'From a personal perspective I feel like a Trump Presidency will adversely affect me from a financial perspective.  He has discussed re-vamping Social Security which with definitely affect me.  I am 60 years old and can retire at 66 and 2 months but he had said that the age to receive full Social Security should be increased.  Unfortunately, most Americans still rely on these benefits for retirement. Trump is an astute businessman and our country could be served well if it were run like a business.  He is a great negotiator and salesman which will help our country internationally when presented with opportunities for such discussions.  His negotiating skills will also help him when dealing with Congress. Trump is arrogant, abrasive, and generally a bully.  He doesn\\'t care about being liked and, in fact, seems to thrive on being disliked.  This personality trait has and will continue to offend others.  Imagine what will happen when he pulls this abrasiveness at a G7 Summit.  What an embarrassment to the US! I certainly can\\'t say one way or the other whether Trump is a Christian.  That would be judging.  However, he doesn\\'t seem to hold the same Christian beliefs I do.  He flip-flops on the abortion issue to suit whatever his political agenda is at the moment.  Today he is pro-life but previously he wasn\\'t.  He stereotypes ethnic groups.  He is condescending to everyone it seems.  He often says \"I love the _______ people.\"  That statement alone is perceived to be condescending to groups different than himself.', 'I\\'m not entirely sure how I will be personally affected by a Trump Presidency. My gut reaction is that he will cause lots of chaos, economically, environmentally, and with foreign relations. I fear there are no benefits to a Trump Presidency except that it would eliminate another Clinton Presidency. The biggest risk with Trump is his unpredictability. He is constantly saying things and then backtracking, claiming he never said it in the first place. I believe the man lack diplomacy which is crucial in a President especially while dealing in foreign relations particularly with the current political climate in the middle east. I\\'m afraid Trump will say or do something that will lead us to war. Though he may claim to be a Christian, his Christianity does not show. I am not God; I cannot speak to the man\\'s soul. But from an outside view I do not believe he is truly a Christian. [Could you please elaborate as to why the only benefit you see to Trump being president is that it would eliminate another Clinton Presidency if you believe he would cause \"lots of chaos, economically, environmentally, and with foreign relations,\" along with the other risks you mentioned. If you believe he is not Christian, what kind of impact does that have on you? Some individuals also believe Trump could lead the US into conflicts with other nations or jeopardize our homeland security. Why do you think then he is still an attractive candidate to voters?] I think the only benefit to trump being president is that Hillary will not be president. I am not a fan of her politics either.   His lack of Christianity doesn\\'t really have an effect on me. I think it does lead to a lack of morals on his part but there have been other presidents in the past who I doubt were truly Christians but they still had a better moral center than trump.   I think his followers are attracted to him for bad reasons. Many of them agree with trumps racist views and he\\'s the first candidate to ever be so clearly bigoted. Sadly, there are many people in America who are just as bigoted so they find him attractive.', \"I feel like I have no idea what Trump will actually do if elected president.  His words and policy's seem to be designed to get the biggest shock value possible.  As such I expect his actions as president would be the same.  I'm scared of what that would do.  What I do know is that if Trump was elected president and followed through on his current ideas I would be scared to be a woman, scared to have health conditions, scared to be a working class American, and scared to have friends who are not white.  The risks of a Trump presidency are total economic collapse and perhaps civil war.  The certainty is racist, sexist, classist policies.  I see no benefits at all to a Trump Presidency.  He is not a Christian man.  He is not even a moral man.  He's a performer looking to get the biggest following by amusing the crowd the most.  Anyone can say they're Christian but if your policies are not compassionate and understanding of human strife then you are not Christian and not fit to lead anyone.\", 'If Trump wins I see a major change in funding for Dept. of Education, as I have a school age child. Other issues are extreme which would not personally affect me (I.e. Gay marriage/anti-abortion/no government investment in retirement funds/etc.). Benefits are that he is a savvy business man. Risks are his traits; my way or highway idea. He does not embody a bipartisan party member. Does not have public resume of service like Hillary. Does not appear as particularly Christian in verse or political demeanor.', \"I think that having Donald Trump has president can have its advantages and disadvantages. He certainly is a trendsetter with a lot of good ideas yet at the same time I am embarrassed at his outlandish behavior when I listen to him inappropriately pontificate about opponents, racial classifications and situations. I am afraid that he will lower the perception of the presidency and our nation.  I would desire for him to get trained on how to professionally speak in public and present reasonable policies without offending groups of people. I find it hard to believe at times that he is a well-educated, successful business man with an impressive family and how he got so far with the way he presents himself to the American public.  He can be shocking.  On the other hand, I admire the fact he has shaken up the political establishment in a way that has brought scrutiny to the 'old ways of doing political business' and that is why he is popular. If he can be a catalyst for change and a visionary for the future, then I want him to do these things but in a manner that does not offend others.  He has gotten all of our attention but I don't want him to waste our time without providing substance to what he promises. I want him to be able to delegate to others to make change come about but do it in a manner that is exemplary for our country and youth.  If he continues in the path of offensiveness, then I think our nation loses credibility and a sense of worth.  Our citizens will then think that being offensive is 'ok' and it's not.  When the issue of practicing one's faith comes to mind for Donald Trump I really don't associate practicing religion with him at all.  I think of him as a business man but not as a man of faith.  I really know nothing of his religious affiliation.  He has raised an impressive family so there must be a value system that he attests to; however, his treatment of other people doesn't correlate to faith based principles. I realize that he must act in a certain way to 'shock' the American people in order to gain their attention but I personally believe that he needs to 'tone' it down a bit and act/speak in a more professional tone.\", \"I really don't see my life being affected if Trump is elected other then setting women’s rights back 50 years. Mr. Trump seems to think women should be at home with babies and not making choices of their own or in a beauty contest. I see no benefit for Mr. Trump being President and I have tried to look, read and listen to a benefit and I see none. I see nothing but a big risk if he became President as he does not get along well with some of the other leaders of other countries (some even will not allow him into their countries) he has stated that he believes in nuclear war and that he knows more about IS then any General does. Mr. Trump does not have any background in politics which at one time I thought would be a good thing but after hearing him speak I don't think so now. Mr. Trump wants it his way or no way which means that him and Congress would be butting heads all the time and no laws would get passed and he would try and fire each and every one that disagreed with him and he would not understand that he did not have the power to do that. Mr. Trump is a Christian? I must have missed when he said that one but then again I tune him out with all the cussing he does. Hmm Mr. Trump as a Christian... he has been married how many times?? Cusses?? Runs a shady investment schooling company?? Degrades people?? Caught in lies and had to back track how many times?? Would you want to have him speak at your church with children there? I have to say that no way that I can see Mr. Trump as a good practicing Christian. [I understand your position on Trump, but I am curious to know if there is anything you could read, listen, or look at that would convince you otherwise that he would make an effective President? Do you believe he is capable of making changes in his behavior to demonstrate he could be an effective leader?  Setting aside what you have already stated about Trump, you believe he is not Christian, does that impact your view of him?] Mr. Trump not acting in what I would think is a moral Christian matter is one of the main reasons I don't think he would make a good President along with his ever changing temperament. In all the time Mr. Trump has been on the campaign trail his temperament and judgement has just gone downhill and I doubt that anyone can help him change or at least tone down his comments and help him focus on the major issues.\", 'If Donald Trump were to be elected my gut feeling is that he would have a negative impact upon me personally. This negative impact could be in the form of higher taxes, no health insurance, loss of a job or any number of other negative happenings that could be directly contributed to Donald Trump becoming President. (Example: Another country becomes so outraged that he is elected, that they plan an attack). I do not see any benefit of a Trump Presidency. I only see negativity if he were elected. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency would be that congress and the senate would be so busy in fighting that nothing would get done. The other risk is that other countries would not support Trump/America politics. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency is that he will anger some extremist group and they would plan an attack. I do not see Trump as a Christian. He does not display Christian values. He has been married 3 times, cheated on his first wife, cheats in his business dealings, I do not feel he is honorable.', \"I don't think I will be personally affected too much because the President really does not have total control or power over issues.  It is handled by Congress who passes the bills. The biggest benefits are that he is a business man who hopefully could handle the national debt better than the previous presidents. The risks are he seems like he is someone you cannot trust.  He is a bully who seems to have no idea of what the issues are for the average American.  He is only for the rich. He does describe himself as a Christian but he does not practice what he preaches.  I saw him mock someone with a disability.  He has absolutely no compassion and that is very scary for a leader of a country.  He also said he was pro-choice but then when he wanted the endorsement of the religious right he changed his mind and now he is pro-life.  He goes with whoever can do the most for him.\", 'I think Trump wants America to start looking at our own problems at home and concentrate more on rebuilding and preserving America. But in doing so he brings the biggest risks of putting America in one of the biggest recessions, even bigger then the great depression it is being said. Possibly 9.4 million jobs will or could be lost which affects the working class that support him the most. That affects everybody. I have had a hard enough time as it is getting a new job but with that man y more people at a loss of a job it could get pretty scary. His economic proposals are super risky. Also the strong language Trump has used towards Mexico and China could ultimately lead to a huge trade war. I don’t see Trump as a Christian at all. He doesn’t embody the Christian spirit or true beliefs.', \"I would like to think that a Trump presidency would be net beneficial to me and my family.  I think that his policies would be divisive, and would either garner strong support or opposition from citizens, but I'm hoping that the balance would be a net positive.  One of the biggest benefits from a Trump presidency would be a strengthening of the United States as a whole on the world stage.  In recent years, the reputation of our country has fallen greatly, with our allies no longer feeling like they can count on us for support, and our enemies no longer fearing us as a superior force.  I would hope that President Trump would be able to remedy this situation. With this recommitment to global power comes many risks as well.  One big one would be how our enemies react to this resurgence of power and authority on the world stage.  Already, forces are using a distributed style of fighting that makes them harder to defeat.  Add to this the boom in immigration to the United States from all over the globe, and it could realistically be a scenario that fighting would start domestically.  I hope this is not the case, but our world seems primed for this sort of event. I am not a good of a Christian as I strive to be, and I would imagine that Trump is not either.  I have heard him state that he is a Presbyterian, and I would hope that some sort of religious underpinning would guide his decisions, despite his outward rhetoric and appearance.  I feel like we will be in need of a strong leader in the coming years, and a moral compass to guide us will be crucial. (Male)\", \"I work at a Bilingual Tax office, and to be honest most of our clients are immigrants. Along with my business being majorly effected, I have friends and co-workers who could be deported because of Trump's arrogance. I think the only benefit of Trump becoming president is that he may stop all of the jobs from going overseas, but on the other side of that coin, we will lose so many workers that we will have too many job openings. The biggest risk I see with Trump becoming president is that he may cause us to fight another war, over his non-diplomatic skill set with other countries. He may lead us into a war that would devastate the United States. I do not see him as a Christian, he is hateful and judgmental to almost everyone. Even during his own rallies, he is rude and pig-headed. (Female)\", 'I am still open to changing my mind regarding whom I would vote for. As of now, however, I think I would, in addition to others, would be affected negatively if Donald Trump won the Presidency. While he does speak what he believes to think as true, which I strongly admire, he has farfetched and radical ideas (completely banning Muslims for a temporary period, although he has backtracked on this, etc.). The biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency are that: he would not relent to lobbyists and he would not cower to world leaders. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency are: economics (as he has not given any true details of anything--everything is focused on \"The Wall\", Muslims, and Clinton\\'s e-mails) and relationships within the U.S. whether it be race, gender, or ethnicity (he continuously makes racist and misogynistic remarks). As for seeing Trump as a Christian, I do not believe he is a TRUE Christian. A true Christian does not throw shade at other races or ethnicities. A true Christian does not suppress women. A true Christian does not joke about individuals with special needs. [You mention that what is admirable about Trump is that he speaks his mind, and he does not relent to outside pressures. Some individuals believe this to be a flaw as his words and behaviors could lead the US to conflicts with other nations or jeopardize our homeland security. What are your thoughts on this? How do you believe Trump could use his beliefs and strong will effectively as a leader?] Him speaking his mind and not relenting to outside pressures can definitely be a negative as well; that\\'s for sure! With how outspoken he is, I definitely see that viewpoint as well. In terms of being steadfast in what he believes and not budging with various international or domestic policies, it could be a positive in that he doesn\\'t back down. He has maintained presence throughout the business world with his companies and has made decisions being steadfast before, so I am sure he can carry that with him if he were to win the Presidency. (Male)', \"These are some really great questions. I am a Trump supporter, but for one reason. He is out in the open. I think that if he is elected, then at least I would know what is going on in our country. I think that many people would benefit from his presidency because he is not going to be a puppet. At the same times, this is a bad thing. He would not have to abide by congress or the legislatures, and why? It is because he has so much money. Is he Christian? Well, I believe that he is, but he has done some very unlike Christian things. Nobody is perfect in the least bit. I think that faith, while does matter, is not the main reason to elect the president. They need to be biased, moral, and able to judge diplomatically. [In what ways does a candidate need to be moral, biased, and judge diplomatically? Some individuals believe that his behavior to not be a puppet could lead the US into conflicts with other nations or jeopardize our homeland security. What are your thoughts on this? Could you please elaborate on your comment about Trump's money and why that would be the reason he would not have to abide by Congress or legislatures?] I think that morality should be in every person. That is the sense that they should do what is right and be honest about it. A candidate can, I do apologize, I meant unbiased. They can be this way by simply accepting everyone. What I mean by judge diplomatically is that you should be able to see when people have done wrong, but also be able to see when they have done right and you need to be able to go by the law and not by what you think. I think that he would not have to abide by congress with his money because they could deny something, but he goes behind their backs, vetoes it, or provides the funds to do so. Can this lead to impeachment? Yes, it most certainly can. I do not think that he really cares about that though. I mean he may abide by them, but at the same time he may just as well think that he can do absolutely anything that he wants and get away with it. I think that it could be a threat to homeland security, but only because we may not know where the funds would actually be going. I hope that this cleared things up. Also, it may be a threat because people who think that he will not be a puppet would feel threatened and they would rebel, but I think that they would only be outraged because he is not following the same guidelines as everyone else. This could lead to riots and protests of sorts. He has got to be careful if elected. (Female)\", \"I don't think I will largely be affected if Trump becomes President. I do fear that certain programs will change like the Affordable Care Act that is crucial in making healthcare for my family affordable. Otherwise, I think the main negative affect from Trump will be in regards to international relations and businesses. The biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency would be have a leader who is bold. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency would be international war, increase in poverty, worsened economic circumstances. I do not see the actions of Trump or words of Trump confirming him as a Christian. (Male)\", 'Being from a small town, I do not feel that I will be personally affected by any person elected President, Trump included. I feel that the benefits of a Trump presidency may be job creation, economic stimulus, and protection from terroristic elements abroad and in country. By the same flip of the coin, I worry that Trump\\'s quote unquote \"protection measures\" may result in civil rights infringement. Also, Trump very well may be a Christian. You can have religious beliefs or leanings, and still be \"politically incorrect\" or offensive to someone in your day-to-day remarks, that doesn\\'t necessarily make you a sacrilegious or unholy person. We are all only human. [Why do you believe being from a small town you feel you will not be personally affected by who becomes President? You state that Trump\\'s policies may lead to civil rights infringements, why do you believe he is still an attractive candidate to voters? It seems that Christian values do not want to jeopardize civil rights. What is your opinion as to why some Christians believe he is the right candidate?] Ultimately, in light of the large number of American citizens, I feel quit insignificant in the grand scheme of things.   2. There is currently a high degree of tension in this nation, be it based on race, politics, religion, or some other human facet. I sometimes feel that Trump makes fiery statements, but that he is simply posturing for his audience.  However, should he come to power and actually get his policies into effective practice, they may or mayn\\'t be infringing towards whatever group they\\'re targeting. Voters back him, however, because they view his show of take-action strength as a means towards national security.    3. Christians may find him attractive because they hold opinions which may literally align with (their individual interpretations) of Biblical doctrine.  Due to the age of the Bible\\'s authorship, certain passages are probably likely to be misconstrued, or more appropriately, lost in the translations which are jaded by 21st century \"logic” or ideology. In this sense, such interpretation may translate roughly, bringing a brusque \"offensive\" to whichever group is in question. (Male)', \"I think I will be personally affected if his decisions are damaging in terms of expanding the powers of the presidency and throwing the balance of powers of course even more than it already is (with Bush and Obama). I am fearful of the overuse of executive actions to do that because ultimately that takes away freedom and that has an impact on individuals, obviously. I think that if he proves capable of leading economically, of stopping illegal immigration, and of not engaging in empire-building foreign wars that are not necessary, that could strengthen the economy, directly impacting me, and give people like me more hope in the future of the country. I think the biggest benefits are the ones just stated: potentially strengthening the economy, no empire-building foreign wars, and stopping illegal immigration. I find the biggest risks of a Trump presidency the overuse of executive authority, whether by executive orders or other means. I am of course equally fearful of this with Clinton though. I find the risk of a tyrant in either of them very large. I am doubtful that Trump is a Christian. I of course don't think anyone can know for sure where another spiritually is at. People who you wouldn't expect to be can be Christians, and people who claim to be aren't necessarily. Trump has said that when asked if he ever repented of anything that he never did because he had nothing to repent of. If that was said in jest, and perhaps it was, then that's no indicator. But if he really meant it then he is not a Christian. To be a Christian you must recognize that you have sinned and that Christ has to provide a covering for those sins in order for you to have eternal life. But I wasn't there, perhaps those words were just said in jest. I wouldn't guess it from his rude and sometimes crude behavior, but some Christians aren't as mature as others - behaving badly doesn't mean you're not a Christian. Some just haven't had much spiritual growth, and it just takes the faith the size of a mustard seed to be a Christian. (Female)\", 'The only way I feel I would be personally affected is with his plans on reforming health care. Many of the issues he is adamant about would honestly have little effect on my life in general. I think the biggest benefits of having Trump in office is that he will not lie as much as others have. I also feel he is concerned with issues that concern America, such as health care, very deeply. I think he will go the extra mile and really try to solve this issue and other issues that are currently being neglected and will try to turn the country around from the direction it is going to a much more prosperous future. The risks I see are his eccentric behavior. I am worried he will be quick to go to war with other countries if he is threatened. I also worry about how far he will really go with his immigration and deportation plans. I think if he \"builds a wall\" and deports a lot of people, it will go against what the country was founded on. Though I do see it as necessary to an extent, I am worried about how the job market and economy will react. If he states he is Christian, I am no one to judge or say that he is not. No one but him and the Lord knows what he truly feels in his heart. I know a lot of negative views of him are out there for some of the things he says and some of the ways he acts. Some of these things could be easily considered not Christian but, once again, if he says he is Christian then he is in my eyes. (Male)', \"I think if Trump wins, our economy will improve. I believe that will have a strong impact on everyone's lives. It is one of the biggest reasons I am voting for him. I also believe that we as a nation will be more secure with Trump as president. And although that might not seem like an obvious day to day difference, it will affect us. The benefits are exactly what I mentioned above. I believe our economy will grow, we will be more secure, and our borders will be more secure. The risks are few in my opinion. However, they are potentially large. I feel like his largest risk is his cockiness in international policy. If he mouths off to the wrong person and speaks from the hip in anger...we could find ourselves in a rather dangerous position. I don't know honestly. He claims to be, and some people that know him better than I do say he is. But he doesn't always act the part. I cannot see into a man's heart especially when I don't know him personally. I have my doubts about his beliefs, but I also give him the benefit of the doubt (Male)\", 'Personally affected: I don\\'t immediately foresee any damages or changes to my daily life (ie I am a US citizen so I won\\'t be on any no fly lists or deportation). Quality of life could change though. I\\'m not sure about what he thinks he\\'s going to change or do for Americans. The benefits of a Trump presidency: Again, I don\\'t really see what benefits to my life there will be. I haven\\'t seen any reason to believe that things are going to be much different. Laws still have to move through the senate; the Supreme Court will stay make their decisions. Biggest Risks: I feel like a Trump presidency is going to downgrade American appeal. Between him and his wife I think the White House will look like a Las Vegas act. As a born-again Christian I have to concede that the Bible teaches that \"man looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks at the heart.\" I can\\'t see Trump\\'s heart. Maybe he is a Christian. However, the Bible also teaches that when someone believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior they will have a change of heart. I don\\'t agree that he lives by Christian morals and that makes it difficult to believe him when he claims to be a Christian. (Female)', \"I think that the only area that a Trump Presidency would affect me directly is in terms of the cost of imported goods that I purchase. Trump frequently flip-flops and is unclear about his stance on a lot of issues, but I feel that he has explicitly promoted a protectionist trade policy. Raising tariffs on imported goods will make the otherwise cheap goods that I buy from abroad, specifically East Asia, more expensive. The one benefit I can think of that may result from a Trump Presidency is increased privatization of Social Security. I think that I would be able to personally invest the money that I pay towards Social Security with greater confidence that it will have appreciated in value by the time I want to retire. The second benefit I see to Trump being in office is a smaller likelihood that we will become involved in foreign entanglements, which we have seen plenty of during the Obama and Bush administrations. One risk I see to a Trump Presidency is an increased likelihood that personal liberties will be eroded at home, which is made evident by his support for spying on those who he sees as potential terrorists. Secondly, I think that environmental policy will take a step backward during a Trump Presidency, as he has expressed a dislike for alternative energy and institutions like the EPA. Third, and probably the biggest risk that I see, is an increased strain on race relations and a general divisive tone across the nation. I can't imagine a President of the United States saying the sort of things that Trump has said on the campaign trail regarding minorities and other groups of people. I recognize that Trump identifies as a Christian, but I do not see him as a Christian for a couple of reasons. First, he has said in interviews that he has never asked God for forgiveness of his sins, nor does he feel the need to. I think that this goes against the core beliefs of any mainstream denomination of Christianity. One cannot be a Christian if he or she does not accept salvation by asking for the forgiveness of sins. What use is Christ's death and resurrection if it does not cover one's sins? This is a major problem with his claiming to be a Christian. Secondly, his behavior and words, again, the way he ridicules minorities, women, and the afflicted, do not reflect the life of someone who is in Christ. I do not see Trump as a Christian, and I frankly find his masquerading as a Christian and pandering to Christians extremely offensive. One specific example of this can be seen in his speech at Liberty University where he mispronounced the name of a book of the Bible and proceeded read scripture that he clearly has no connection to, all in the name of seeking political gain. (Male)\", \"The US will radically change if he becomes president because he will implement crazy ideas whenever possible. My life personally will not be affected a whole lot aside from maybe taxes. The biggest benefits are that he doesn't support gay marriage or the foolishness of allowing transgender to go to whichever bathroom they want. The biggest risks are war and calamity. Trump does not seem afraid to push the big red button. He will go to war with China and Russia at the same time and not even break a sweat. He is a businessman that is too used to steamrolling everyone but the US isn't as smart and powerful as it used to be. Donald trump fails to accurately describe himself. He is not a Christian or a God fearing man in any type of way. He does not follow Christ which is the definition of a Christian. (Male)\", 'If Donald Trump were to the win the election the biggest immediate change for me will be a slight decrease in my taxes, and probably the ability for my fiancé and I to keep more of our income once we are married. From a social standpoint I\\'m honestly not sure. The reality is most of the changes he wants are still going to have to get through congress, and at this point people seem to have lost a significant amount of respect for him, so I believe his influence will be far less than most people expect it to be, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. The biggest benefits of Trumps presidency mostly center around the fact he is not tied down to congress, he will stand up for what he believes in, but also listen to the people on votes. I think his independence of the system is what will set him apart as an appropriate president. The biggest risk I see with Trump is going to be how he handles foreign policy, and if he will be able to work with our allies even if they don\\'t do things the same way he wants to do them. When it comes to faith, Donald Trump is not a Christian, he is not a born again follower of Jesus Christ, and the only relationship he has to the name \"Christian\" is nominal in nature. He does not exude the fruit of the spirit. (Male)', \"I will be embarrassed that such a clown is in the White House. He seems so childish, and he is so stubborn in his beliefs that he even refuses to listen to people who believe something else in a reasonable manner. The only plus to a Trump presidency is that he might help to conserve a more conservative leaning in the House and Senate. The risks are that he's going to bully his way through the presidency. He's had so much power in the way he does business, that it's going to transfer into the presidency. I don't see Trump as a Christian. There's no way he acts and treats people the way he does and be a man of the Christian faith. (Female)\", \"I am smack dab in the middle class, so I don't think Trump would affect me economically at all. The thing that scares me the most is that fact that he doesn't seem to be taking things seriously. I'm afraid what he's saying will negative effect other countries' opinions of us causing a war. 2) He seems to be pretty honest. He also has a good business sense and could hopefully work on the deficit. 3) He's arrogant and rude...especially to immigrants. I do think he's right in the sense that there needs to be stricter guidelines as far as who comes into the country, but he's being really offensive and people aren't hearing his real points. They're only focusing on his negative comments. 4) A Christian? Maybe. A good Christian? No. Just because you go to church and believe in God doesn't make you a good Christian. You need to live a positive, non-judgmental life (or at least make an effort to do this) which he is not doing at all. (Female)\", 'I have no idea how I will be personally affected or if I will be affected if Trump is elected president. I\\'m guessing that my individual life may not change much if any with the exception of taxes potentially going up. I think Trump would cause taxes to go up because of his plan to increase border and immigration controls and restrictions. The biggest benefit of a Trump presidency is security for America and a focus on improving our economy and hopefully our outlook over ALL. If he is smart, He will delegate the task of \" making America Great Again\" to others who can do just that and appoint the key people as military, security, economic advisors and finally, a trustworthy person just to help him keep himself out of trouble with the media and others. Trump knows how to work the legal and tax systems in place and how to take advantage of loopholes in the law and constitution. My hope is that he will use these skills to help make America Great again. The biggest risk of Trump as president, would be whether he can keep his cool in confrontations with other world leaders in order to prevent WWIII from being unintentially ignited. There is also the risk that Trump will find every way possible to benefit himself and his own businesses at the expense of taxpayers. Christian? He may be a Christian by default, since he\\'s not Muslim or Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist or whatever. He supposedly doesn\\'t drink or smoke or do drugs and believes in a \"Higher Power\" but his over the top lifestyle (including multiple marriages and divorces) of excess and lack of moderation and well, \"slick\" if not \"slimy\" exterior does not reflect anything Christian to me. If he were in the military and had to put a religious affiliation on his dog tags, I would expect it would be stamped Protestant Christian and that\\'s about it, the extent of his faith as I see it. Donald Trump a Christian? Are you kidding? What\\'s in his heart may be very different, but from what I have seen and heard, I don\\'t think Donald Trump could pray his way out of a paper bag!', \"Well its little scary to think if he becomes president.  I think it will give more hate groups power.  I have 2 half black children and a Puerto Rican husband and a child with him .so who knows what craziness he will start.  I find no benefit for him to be our president.  He couldn’t even run his own business how can he run our country?  Bankruptcy after bankruptcy.  He treated his employees like crap.  We will have a lot of problems with other countries if he wins. Our military will be fighting everyone.  More money wasted on war.  No I definitely don't see him as a Christian.  His wife isn’t good enough to a first lady.  Naked pictures playboy.  No not tasteful at all.\", \"I think if Trump becomes president we will be in a war in less than four years. Also we will lose a lot of our alias just because he is so blunt. He is not one to not say how he feel. It will affect a lot of government programs. Meaning welfare social security benefits. I am on ssi due to seizures. I'm terrified that my insurance will be affected. The biggest benefits would be he would try to cut back on the refugee's coming in our country. And he would make it harder for people to get government benefits. I fought for four years for mine. I find it very annoying when someone comes from a different country and gets welfare right away. The risks are being at war. He has a don't give a damn attitude and a leap first without thinking about it first. Also assignation someone trying to kill him. He again speaks like he is predijust. I think he would bring terror attacks from other countries and it would be a mess. As for him being Christian he doesn't act like one. A Christian is to be Christ like he is far from that.\", \"As a celebrity, Trump was amusing. I used to watch the Apprentice for the first few years. Being the president of the United States is different though. He is rude and crude and offends everyone. If he is elected, how will other countries see us? Will we become a joke or will people be so offended by him that they stop dealing with us? These are things that may not seem to affect my day to day, but they will definitely affect my life. It is scary to think how much power we may give him! The benefits of a Trump presidency seem to be few. Hopefully, he will get things done that have not been done. He does not think like a normal politician as he is not one, so hopefully he will see things that need to change and do them. I hope he creates jobs and takes care of Americans. He has never been afraid to speak his mind, so I hope he will use that to America's advantage. That being said, he is dividing the nation with his speech. He is racist and sexist and against immigration-the very thing that this country was built on. I am praying that he is acting this way and exaggerating his personality in order to get attention during the election process. I really don't think he thought he would get this far, but now he does not want to lose. I am not sure he really wanted to be president! I hope that if he is elected, he will settle down and be a business man again. If Donald Trump says he is a Christian, I have no way of knowing if he is or not. I cannot see inside his heart. I pray he is and that he begins to act like one. I pray he believes in Jesus and that his heart is softened to this country and what we need. He needs to listen to his Creator and use wisdom in his choices. As of right now however, I do not see him acting like a Christian.\", \"If Trump wins, I believe the country in general will change a lot. I see him as running the nation as he would a business. The rich will become richer the poor will become poorer. I will become poorer. He seems to be all about money. I think if he becomes president there will be a huge reform with the welfare system which may be good, it could potentially stop those who are abusing the system. However, it could also hurt those who really do need the assistance. I do not see Trump as a Christian. He is like most American's who claim to be Christian but are nowhere near what the Bible would describe as Christian. Trump has offended many with things he has said, when he speaks he does not show a Christian attitude of love for others. Just because a person claims to be Christian does not make them a Christian.\", \"I don't know how I might be affected if Donald Trump wins the presidency. I would hope that the economy would be stimulated and that the whole economy would basically pick up. This would change my life. As I mentioned before, we have a business and all of the relevant parts of this business are still around waiting to be picked up. The only thing we lack is customers. If the customers come back, then I can start building towards a middle-class existence again. Perhaps my husband would be able to quit his low-paying service job. That is how I hope it would be affected. And if not that then I hope that I would pay less in taxes because we are making just less and less and less every year for the past several years now.\", 'The biggest benefit to that Donald Trump could give me is to restart the economy so we can be in control of our lives again and run our own business as we desire to. This country needs a middle class. Whatever needs to be done to bring it back this should be done as soon as possible. Otherwise more and more people are just going to be in my position.', \"The biggest risk with this President, is the same as it is with any president. And that risk is that we will get into a long expensive War with another country. The ultimate nightmare scenario would be nuclear war. No I don't think this would happen. But nobody thought that we were going to go to war with bush W was elected. That was a big surprise. You just never can know.\", \"If Trump wins the presidency, it's hard to say exactly how that would affect me personally.  On one hand, I live in a southern border state, based on his stance on illegal immigration, I may see differences in how our borders are maintained, which could mean more security in my state.  On the other hand, he is a rich business man, and I worry that he can't relate to a blue collar family like mine, and that will show in how he handles taxes and healthcare.  I feel like foreign policy is a big risk with a Trump presidency.  Trump has a strong presence, most people either love him or hate him and he doesn't seem to care either way.  I worry that he could make the wrong people angry and cause a strain in our relationship with other countries. Donald Trump's faith is very hard to read for me, it's easy to call himself a Christian, but he's blunt and opinionated and doesn't apologize for that.  I question whether a man that would call a woman a dog on national tv, has any faith at all. [Many individuals have stated that they believe Trump's actions and behavior could lead the US into conflicts with other nations and cause homeland security issues. What are your thoughts as to why individuals still find him as an attractive candidate even though he could lead the US into the situations you described?] I think people just find him different!  He's not polished like other politicians, he's not rehearsed, he has knee jerk reactions in public forums and people relate to that.  I also think many people mistake his bluntness for honesty.  They think because he presents himself the way he does, he must be telling the truth.\", \"I don't know if I will be personally affected if Trump wins the Presidency, but I suspect that my job in education will be affected in terms of policy. I also suspect that my health care costs may be affected. The biggest benefit of a Trump Presidency would be the possibility of a more balanced budget. The biggest risk that I see is the possibility of his foreign policy (or lack thereof) becoming a security hazard for our nation. No. I do not see Trump as a Christian. I think he puts people down, talks in circles, and is not trustworthy---none of those things point to Christianity for me.\", 'I think I would be personally affected if Donald Trump wins the election in several ways.  First, I would feel safer because I trust him to secure the border and take a stronger stand against ISIS terrorists and other radical Islam.  Second, I hope he would improve the economy through more conservative economic principles and that could result in improved wages through growth of the economy.  Third, I would expect him to appoint more conservative Supreme Court Justices and this would result in me feeling more comfortable with the outstanding court cases and any unforeseen court cases.  Lastly, I would anticipate he would balance the budget and begin deficit reduction and this would improve my children\\'s future which brings me some comfort. The biggest benefits of a Trump Presidency is he has a history as a successful businessman and CEO and I suspect this experience could be good for America.  He also has indicated he plans to take strong stances on immigration and terrorism and this is definitely needed in our country.  He has a Spiritual Advisory Board and I think this will benefit him in his selections of Supreme Court Justices.  Also, the country will benefit from his pro-America stance in all areas. It could also be a benefit that he is an outsider when it comes to Washington politics and he has never dealt with lobbyists or special interest groups. The biggest risks of a Trump Presidency is what I just mentioned as a possible benefit---he has never held a political office before and does not have a record for us to judge.  I am concerned that he has donated to Democrats in the past and I am also concerned he will be willing to negotiate on issues that he should take a hard stance on.  Another risk is how he is going to be viewed by other governments.  He has made big promises to the American people and he will need to work hard to accomplish them if elected. As I said in a previous post, man cannot judge the heart of man, only God.  However, Scripture also tells us you can judge a Christian by the fruit he produces.  Donald Trump has professed that he is a Christian.  My concerns is that he said he has done nothing that needs forgiveness.  For me, the first step to a saving relationship with Jesus Christ is to admit that you are a sinner, born into sin as stated in Romans that \"all have fallen short of the glory of God.\" This concerns me about Trump\\'s testimony.  However, I recently read James Dobson describe him as an immature Christian.  I know from my own personal relationship with Christ that I have matured through sanctification by studying God\\'s Word.  So, is he a Christian? I\\'m not sure but I do pray he has a saving faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.', \"With a Trump presidency I don't see my life changing much.  If he does his job right, life should carry on without him being in the news much. I think one of the biggest benefits of a Trump presidency is that the Obamacare legislation will be revisited and revised. I also think he'll address Islamic terrorism. One of the biggest risks of a Trump presidency is that he'll go back to being a loose cannon and continue to insult people. I know he claims to be a Christian, a lot of people claim the same thing and use it as an umbrella term, but I don't see him that way.\", \"I doubt I will be personally affected if Donald Trump wins the election. I might be disappointed by my fellow Americans, but I'll be disappointed by them no matter who wins this election because of the candidates. I live in a smaller town where things stay much the same and do not work in a position likely to be directly affected by the outcome. I think the benefits to his potential presidency could be the changes to our health care system. He sees the flaws in Obamacare and as someone whose employer sponsored health insurance tripled as a result, I would like to see changes! As a married couple household, I also see the benefits to lower taxes on working families which would be funded by higher taxes on high incomes. I can also see the benefits of his stance on a waiting period for guns and banning assault weapons. I see the risk of his presidency as him. I think he is very tactless and cannot imagine hi putting his ego aside to do what is best for our country. I feel he would be a risk in his behavior toward presidents, diplomats and high ranking officials of other countries. I don't see him as a Christian. Some of his statements (i.e. About banning Muslim immigrants and sending illegals away) speak to his not having a heart for Christ. His personal life with multiple divorces and remarriages also speaks to him not following.\", \"Today I have such mixed feelings about Donald trump my feelings surrounding him from the past up till very recently has been impacted by the turmoil and lack of respect I've witnessed. I watched his speech last night in Ohio and was flabbergasted at his attitude I reach my children to respect others and respect difference of opinion what has unfolded I've the last few days in real time and the commentary on social media is distributed death threats personal attacks ... How I'll if affect me I don't know how it will at this moment in time -- a non-Washington perspective business success fresh ideas biggest risks ... His dismissiveness of inappropriate actions comments and his kinship with white supremest groups they feel as if he is speaking in code to them and he hasn't strongly condemned them .... So it's s concern if he takes that attitude into the White House in would like him to consenteste on issues they are affecting my and others do is we him as a Christian .... Yes, but not necessarily a man of strong faith. [I understand you watched Trump's speech in Ohio and have mix feelings about him. As the election continues, what would you need to hear or relate to from either of the candidates to feel more reassured? You believe that Trump is not a man of strong faith, does this belief impact you significantly or are other risks more impacting?] The thing is if he is a man who respects and practices faith it has become increasingly difficult to observe that .... I need to see integrity and a shift in the tone it's difficult to get past this excessive vitriol and consider the real issues facing the country .... I think faith AIDS you at time like this so I would need to see along with traditional positions on issues facing the county and the world a concrete demonstration of Faith's tenants\", \"I think I would be affected by a downturn in the economy, as his ideas regarding economic protectionism will only harm the United states.  I think the biggest benefit of a Trump presidency will be a decrease in terrorism.  The biggest risk would be to the economy and to conservatism as a movement or faction of the Republican party. Whether he's is Christian or not is purely between him and God, but as the bible says, he will be judged by his fruit.\", \"I think that he might cut Medicare benefits, because he's all about the wealthy people like himself.  This will affect myself as I'm disabled, also my parents as well. the biggest benefit would be that he would work on keeping illegals from coming into our country, which would save the government a ton of money. I think the biggest risks would be him cutting the benefits of SNAP, Medicare and medical benefits for kids and low income people. I believe that Trump is saying he is Christian because of the majority of the people in the US are Christian.  That way he will appeal to more people to get votes.\", \"I do not see Trump as a Christian, because of his actions with his tweets. [If you believe that Trump says he is a Christian because the majority of the people in the US are Christian, how does that make you feel? Does it bother you? I understand you do not see Trump as a Christian because of tweets, is it just his tweets you find unchristian or other forms of communication he has used?] I'm not happy about that myself.  However, he’s not pulling the wool over my eyes.  That is so fake.  Trump on his show was horrible to the non-celebrity people on it.  There's a way to say things and then there's a way to say things.  He wasn't kind to those people.\", \"How do I think I will be affected with a Trump presidency...Although he is not my ideal, I think my life will be affected positively from his victory? He will strengthen the military, and as a US Army vet I understand how and why this is so important. I think the economy will grow stronger under a leader who wants us to flourish rather than die (like the current resident in office) 2. The biggest benefits to a Trump presidency: a. Economy awakens b. Military strength c. control over our borders d. less authoritarian political correctness 3. The biggest risks of a Trump presidency: Other countries will see we have a strong leader b. He is temperamental, but FAR LESS temperamental than the queen of Hell herself named Clinton c. He will ruffle political feathers and shake things up 4. Donald Trump describes himself as a Christian. There are two types of Christians - Surface Christians and Deep Christians. He, of course, is a surface Christian. But so was I until 5 years ago, and even though my faith was somewhat weak, I do believe in God and tried to be a good person. That's about where he is, I think. Trump does not cometo the presidency after spending 20 years listening to an evil devil-inspired demon like Jeremiah wright who hates white people like Obama did. He is also more a Christian than the current resident in office, who was raised as a Muslim (this is detailed in his book, this is not me just bloviating).\", \"When and if Donald Trump wins (and I am hoping he does) I will feel safer knowing he is in charge of taking care of our country's security and wellbeing. He isn't afraid to fight back. We need someone in office that will stop giving away tons of money that this country could use for our own. We take better care of people in other country's than we do our all and he'll do away with that. The only risks that I can see is the GOP not uniting with him. A lot of government people don't like him because he's going to shake things up in Washington. Yes, I do believe Donald Trump is a Christian, he's a good husband, father, and business man. He wouldn't have gotten this far in life if he wasn't a man of God. [Hello again, I believe people are afraid of Trump shaking things up in Washington because of his language and behavior. What do you say to those individuals who believe Trump will shake things up, but are concerned of how he will do it?] I think that by the time he gets to Washington he will have the best advisors who will advise him to tone it down. I am hoping he shacks up Washington but I'd like to see it done right. I believe he knows he should and he has gotten better but he's not really good at it yet.\", \"I don't really like anything about it, but if I had to choose it would be the part about him giving very little to charities. I think that he would serve better promoting different charities than just giving and being yet another well-known name on their walls. [What about giving to charities do you like? If Trump gives to charities, is he not representing good Christian values by giving to others?] I like giving to charities because I am helping a worthy cause that means something to me. In some instances, that help is given through a monetary donation and in other instances I volunteer my time. I think we should think of helping charities with a mix of time, talent and treasure. If Mr. Trump gives to charities it is a start, but he is still missing giving of his time and talent.\", \"I know that Pope Francis had disagreed with Donald Trump on political policy making. I am a Catholic and I respect Pope Francis but I did not appreciate a religious leader interfering with his views on how to make policy within our nation.  I thought that the Pope needs to stay out of politics and stay governing the church where his speciality lies.  If a political leader asked for the Pope's advice then that is another side to the story; however, I think the Pope overstepped his authority.  On the other hand, I am interested to know more about charity contributions made by Donald Trump.   He does employ a number of workers and he has created opportunities for employment.  It would be nice to hear more about if he has contributed to worthy causes.  Perhaps he has but we are not aware of his works of mercy.\", 'I am a catholic but get so turned off by the way it always comes down to money for them. So what he doesn’t give to charity. Is it because he doesn’t give to them? [I understand your point that if Trump does not give to charity, it is because he does not give to charity. If Trump did give to charity, would that not demonstrate he has a priority to give to the needed and the less fortunate compared to not giving? How do you believe Trump should demonstrate his priorities?] I just don’t beleive that giving to a charity is a priority. Some people are generous and give and some people are not I don’t think people should be judged on that.', \"As a Catholic the lack of compassion is what stood out to me too. Although like I mentioned before it's hard to tell if this is really him or just a skit in order to get more media time and getting his bold suggestions across the country. And also he did donate a large sum of money to the veterans during one of his campaign stops which I believe was Iowa or Indiana, one of the I states.\", \"I totally agree with this statement so there isn't anything I don't like about it.  It speaks the truth.  What I don't like are the facts presented.  While Trump does donate to charity, a majority of it flows through his own Foundation.  Based on his wealth the amount he donates is minimal. Trump is not interested in really helping others unless it promotes his own agenda.  He supports groups or organizations if, and only if, it will benefit him in the long run.  For example, he will support groups on opposite ends of the spectrum if he thinks it will get him votes.\", 'What do they mean by different priorities?', \"I would like to see the whole picture.  How much has been investigated and researched into charity work or supported causes by Donald Trump.  Yes, the Catholic church supports a lot of service related activities, yet at the same time the Vatican, it's banks, real estate, artwork and other possessions amount to a great deal. Some of these investments if put to good use could help feed a 3rd world country.  I think that the Catholic Church and its hierarchy need to stay out of the facets of politics and take a closer look at not being so judgmental in their views against women's rights, gay marriage and birth control. etc. I take offense at this statement.  Recently our local archbishop made a statement about refusing divorced couples, gays and others the ability to receive communion at mass.  He basically was shunning certain groups of individuals.  This is real hypocrisy in the making.\", \"He seeks to enrich himself and become even more famous. He spends little time serving others and gives very little to charity. These statements stand out to be as this seems to be the core of Trump's personality. Mr. Trump has shown no proof at all as to what charities he supports or has given his time to. Mr. Trump has not shown his tax statement so he seems to be hiding how much he is or is not worth and what companies he does support. Mr. Trump is an actor at heart and you can tell that he loves to hear himself speak. At the debates he would hardly let anyone else talk by either interrupting them or shouting over them. He is rude when he talks to people and he if he becomes president only the rich will benefit as he has made it clear that he wants to cut taxes for the rich.\", 'I have found from experience that statements like this early have the whole picture taken into consideration when stated.  Add to this that many people try to incorrectly characterize others who don\\'t fit their specific mold of what a \"Christian\" should be.  I think Trump could be characterized in a similar fashion.  There is no denying his financial success; with a net worth of $4.5 billion, so say he has enriched himself would be an understatement.  As far as donating to charity, that is a slippery slope:  I conduct many charitable acts that go unpublished and unrecognized; this is how I want it to be.  I would imagine Trump does similar things, especially on the scale that he is able to operate at. (Male)', 'I find that this whole statement could be researched and found to be false.  I would be more inclined to believe that this statement was meant more to polarize public opinion than to guilt Trump into being more outward in his charitable activities.  I would want more facts to be presented before a statement like this would sway my opinion of the candidate. (Male)', \"I don't like anything about this, and I don't believe those statements are true. Donald Trump has and does donate plenty of money to charity's. I have read articles from families who are in need due to either health or job reasons and he has taken care of all of the expenses. I believe he is a very smart man and a lot of people are jealous of his success.\", \"I think this is a poor, misguided somewhat ignorant soul who should try to open their hearts and minds and not be so corrupted by the Clintons and Obamas' evil greed. I will not highlight anything because it's all pretty bland, untrue and originated by a low-information voter. I will pray that they will become more informed.\", \"I like that it talks about building bridges. In order to build bridges sometimes we need to build walls first to build bridges the proper way. [How would we need to build bridges the proper way? What does that entail and do you believe Trump is capable of building that way?] You need a strong foundation to support the weight of a bridge properly. There are times when the bridge can be at its maximum capacity and if the foundation isn't strong enough, it then collapses. Trump seems focused on building walls and I haven't determined yet if he is capable of somehow using those as a foundation for bridges. Perhaps Pope Francis will eventually have an impact on him.\", \"I don't like This is not the gospel. It seems like it doesn't fit in with talking about a politician. It is not relevant.\", \"I do agree that Trump is bullyish in quite a few of his comments but it's so hard to tell if he's making them for the cameras so they stay on him versus those are his actual opinions. I think right now it's all for attention as a child would who wants the lollipop. But in reality he has made quite a difference in his supporters and the Make America Great Again hats were a huge hit and made in the US so he actually was doing what he was professing and brought back a job to the US.\", 'He bullies opponents.... Just watch the exchange between he and M. Kelley. He deferred an answer and attacked her. He has no filter. I think that this statement is true. I agree that Trump bullies his opponents and speaks openly about gender and race in an offensive manner that is unbecoming to a leader of a country.  He should treat others with more respect and stand up for what he believes in through a more effective and civil manner.  He can be motivating, yet at the same time he needs to be more sensitive to what is deemed appropriate behavior.', 'I agree that Mr. Trump does bully people he feels are not as good as him.  He does not treat others as we want to be treated.  According to Christian doctrine he is certainly not following the rule.  Treating others respectfully should just be something everyone does, not just because of the golden rule.  He loves to make fun of people and that is a sure sign of someone we would not want to be around, let alone be President.', 'It’s true he does bully the opponents. But all elections in the past they bullied each other. He does take it to the extreme. He says what he wants. But should think a bit before he speaks', 'Not exactly fully correct. Read Matthew 22:34-40 Christ teaches us the Greatest Commandment: \"Love the L-rd your G-d with all our heart and soul and mind\" \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" All the Law and the prophets hang on these two commandments. To accuse Trump of \"not following the golden rule\" or bullying just sounds silly and petty. This is Politics, it\\'s dirty and grubby and absurd and disgusting and immoral. Besides, if someone is going to throw some accusations, then there should be facts to back it up.', '\" Mr. Trump does not follow the Golden Rule. He bullies opponents, women and minorities\" So true! I would hope that any person elected to represent this country at the very least could follow the golden rule!  In the few times I have watched him on tv I\\'ve noticed the bullying, and it\\'s the main thing that has put me off of him as a candidate.', \"I don't know what to make of this statement. I sort of need to know who is saying it and what their agenda is before I can judge it. Everyone has an agenda, sadly. Even the survey seems to have an agenda. It would be nice if these statements were labeled with the speaker.\", \"I least like that he stokes fear of the most vulnerable among us for his own political gain. He stokes fear because there is reason for fear. We have had mass shootings, bombings, etc. and nobody currently does anything to stop this. It is not for political gain. It is the truth. [I understand you believe Trump is speaking the truth when he says people need to fear, how do you think he is going to bring about subduing that fear when some people believe he purposely wants to make people fearful?] I don't know if he is capable of subduing the fear that he himself has stoked\", 'I believe that the pope needs to stay out of politics and administer to religion and church dealings. If he only knew how exclusionary his bishops have become in their own dioceses and how cover ups on banking and sexual molestation has impacted enrollment in parishes, schools and churches then he would be concentrating more on church issues rather than politics. Perhaps the pope needs to open the Vatican and house refugees instead of interfering in politics. I think that a private meeting with the Pope and Trump would have been productive.', 'Mr. Trump stokes fear I find it hard to believe that one person even Mr. Trump has the power to cause fear for much of anything even for political gain. I think people are tired of politician and their lies and not being able to get anything done that some people think Mr. Trump would be good for the country but as time goes on people will see him for what he is, a bigot with a lot of money. [Hello, why do you find it hard to believe that one person has the power to cause fear for so many?] I guess I have to retract that statement because look what Hitler was able to do for years and to thousands of people. I guess looking back through history a lot of dictators were able to harm or kill millions of people. Good thing the US is not a dictatorship and limits the power of the President because Trump might be able to pull off some of the things he wants to do like build a wall.', \"Refugees fleeing persecution should stay in their own part of the world where their views are more familiar and secure. Good for Trump for seeing that. Let's do follow God's teaching and fight against sharia law female mutilation, justified gang rapes, and slaughtering gays and Christians -- Actually these are among the people who are flooding the Clinton’s accounts with funding! Someone PLEASE tell this misguided person being quoted about the real horrors behind the evil liar presidential candidate.\", 'Again what I like least is that the writer has used Christian to get my attention, but doesn\\'t seem to be Christian and it just comes off awkward after reading and rereading. \"Mr. Trump stokes fear....\" This is just political rhetoric and or posturing. The whole idea of a political campaign is to affect people\\'s emotions, love, hate, fear, sympathy etc. If a candidate cannot find a way to affect and connect via emotional commentary, then why would anyone bother to listen? Again use of \"G-d\\'s teaching\" to get my attention as a Christian. I do not know if any of the accusations are 100% correct. I would like to see some facts or documentation after accusing Trump.', \"I don't really understand this author's complaint that Trump doesn't respect the God-given dignity of others because that's more of an opinion versus a truth. Trump is speaking on what he believes to be true which to others they don't believe in such as building a wall or abortion. He has a blunt way of proposing and talking about ideas however what he believes should change in the country is how he how he's explaining his dignity of others.\", \"Why is the pope casting such criticism?  If the pope were truly concerned and thought that he could make an impact upon a future leader, why not meet privately, and discuss concerns. I liken this situation to a circumstance that arose in my daughter's school.  A principal openly humiliated a student in front of the class to make a point. If the principal had truly been concerned about the welfare, mental state and dignity of the student then she would have privately discussed the matter. Instead the administrator made a public display so that the student was made an example of.  Is the pope not doing the same to Donald Trump?  Is he not putting Trump to shame? [Hello again. I understand you believe the Pope and Trump should be meet privately to discuss their differences, but why do you believe the Pope has made such statements? What were his objectives? Do you believe they have significance with Catholics or do many see the Pope putting Trump to shame?] I think both the Pope accomplished both in making his statements pertaining to Trump.  I believe that the Pope wants Catholics to vote for Trump perhaps now but maybe not in the beginning when there were many more candidates to choose from. I think he wanted to take a position, express his opinion and shame Trump.  If he didn't want to shame him publicly then the Pope would have met with him privately first. Unfortunately for the pope and many fellow Republicans, Trump became the presumptive nominee and won over other options that they would have preferred. I think that the Pope outwardly stated his opinion because he may upset with a Republican acting in such a manner. Even though there are Catholics that belong to either party, the church in no way supports the liberal views around gay marriage, transgender rights, prochoice, stem cell research, living together prior to marriage and birth control just to mention a few.  Nevertheless, I think the church advocates more the Republican views on these issues. But who in their intelligent mind would advocate how Trump treats and marginalizes groups of people.  I will have more to comment on tomorrow based upon the mass visit I made today and what I heard the priest stating regarding gospel lessons and today's politics but I believe that what the church teaching is terms of how we should be treating people and how we should be unifying not excluding is true. It's just that I think the church is segmented too.  Not everyone from the pope, to bishops to priests and to the congregation are speaking the same language and supplying the same accepting and unifying message unfortunately.\", 'What I like least is that It is, unfortunately, is that it is a pretty accurate description of the behavior of this presidential candidate.', \"I don't really find offense to knocking the crap out of someone throwing a tomato because we as a society have become very sarcastic in nature and if someone really did knock someone out I don't see a strong influence from Trump. The Pope said he would knock someone out too whoever talked about his mother wrongfully. So I like how Trump is not afraid to add in today's sarcasm to his political campaign.\", \"I really don't see anything as violent or hateful in his speech. This goes back to the fact that everyone will be offended by something and apparently whoever wrote these remarks doesn't recall any sarcastic things they've said before. I think it's brave and bold of Trump to talk like this on his campaign and whoever does act out on this has some mental issues themselves not to blame Trump. It's like the woman who sued McDonald’s because her coffee was too hot, ridiculous.\", '\"knock the crap out of someone who throws a tomato.\" How is this man a candidate for the Presidency?  I don\\'t understand how he can say stuff like this and still have followers.', \"Instead of just complaining about the conditions, I think that suggesting solutions, changes and modification need to be suggested. Was this quote taken out of context Was there more to the story that meets the eye?  How could Trump get away with all of this without being reprimanded by the Republican National Party?  Why was he not rebuked by them?  Politics seems to be very dishonorable. [Hello, you ask some good questions. Why do you think Trump as not been reprimanded or rebuked by the Republican Party?] I think that they either afraid of him, know they can't control him or secretly support his methods. I lump all of them together (i.e. the Republican party) as a whole but do realize that they really are fractured into several groups working against or with each other. I do not think they as a party (nor the Democrats either) are solidified as a unified group.  Because of this segmentation, they can't seem to control Trump and are surprised to his rise and success among voters.\", 'I don\\'t think this is appropriate for a Presidential Candidate to tell people.

This goes back to my opinion that he is not a polished professional acting candidate. I think he speaks before he thinks and or knows what will get the crowed going.

The statements seem aimed at getting me to judge Donald Trump the candidate for President according to Christian values and beliefs when I don't really think he has professed to be a committed Christian. Now if it were Billy Graham or Robert Schuller or Joel Osteen, it would be a different story. If they exhibited the same methods and said the same things we hear from Trump on the campaign, then sure, throw the book at him. Also if you are going to use Christian phrases or references, know the original source and understand it clearly as well as the other scriptures that are related to it whether they be in old or New Testament and quote them chapter and verse. As for Judging Donald Trump, I would judge him as an international businessman and investor because THAT is where he DOES claim skill and experience.\", 'We need to know who says these things.  I guess I could Google this statement, so I will.  OK.  I cannot find who said it.  Who said it?

It would be nice to know who said these statements as it may have added to whether I felt they were reliable sources. I don't believe everything I hear, even if it is coming from a religious leader. Unfortunately, some of them are just as corrupt as some of the politicians.\", 'st time we were together we asked you to attend religious services if you could. Describe what happened if you were able to attend services. Did the priest say anything that you felt was relevant to think about in this upcoming presidential election?  Whether or not you attended services, what would you like to hear from priests about how they are considering their faith in the upcoming presidential election?  Has your priest talked about the Presidential race in the past? Have they mentioned anything about the tone of the Presidential campaign? If so what have they talked about? Has it made an impact on how you think about the campaign?', 'The priest talked about the good Samaritan in his homily this weekend and posed the question, \"Who is our neighbor?\" Several people passed by the man in need, but not the good Samaritan, he showed mercy and helped and that\\'s what we should do as well. No, our priest does not talk about the Presidential race or politics.', 'He has not mentioned the elections at all. But if he did I would hope that he would tell people to vote for someone who will make the country better not only financially but morally as well.', 'I was unable to attend religious services on Sunday, as I was unexpectedly called into work. In the past 3 Sunday\\'s the priest has not said anything regarding the Presidential race. As far as the tone of the Presidential campaign, there hasn\\'t been any mention of that either. What has made me think about the Presidential Campaign is the shootings of the Police Officers in Dallas. I don\\'t believe the Presidential candidates have spoken about the great divide in America between the police and blacks, who keep being shot by the police. It seems that the \"real\" problems or issues are being ignored by the Presidential candidates. This Presidential campaign has brought up issues that aren\\'t really issues, I feel in an attempt to take our minds off the real issues. Real issues, such as why are so many Police shooting unarmed blacks? Why are employers allowed to not pay overtime or benefits to employees by making them \"contract employees\" Why does Trump state he wants to bring back jobs to America, when his own daughter\\'s clothing line is made overseas.', 'I went to Church on Sunday. I listened carefully to what he said, but a lot of it had to do with Dallas, Minnesota and Louisiana. What I could relate to the election was that we must love each other as family. We are no different from another simply because of the color of our skin. We bleed and feel the same way. These things made me think about how Hilary seems to have empathy for everyone and not just those in her economic status. My Priest does not usually mention politics or any particular candidate. He focuses more on family, love and forgiveness.', \"I did attend my local Catholic church this Sunday hoping the priest would mention something in his homily and he did! I was shocked because I missed the last week and thought maybe something was mentioned then but I guess this election year really everyone is talking about it. He started with his homily talking about as Christians we are called to love our enemies and in the election what everyone is doing is condemning the character of each other more then their actions. I felt he was actually walking a thin line because at times in his homily it could be misconstrued that he was sounding like a Hillary sympathizer. He talked about how she was cleared of all charges brought against her and that people were angry at the judgement assuming the judgment was wrong. Well, in a lot of people's reality they do feel the judgement was wrong and corrupt. But the priest wanted to make a point that the judgement was accurate and people were still outraged attacking her character. For me personally I do think the judgement was corrupt a certain extent due to the fact she has a lot of strings she can pull her way in Washington. It didn't really change my opinion on the election. It did have an impact on me when he kept saying how as Christians we are supposed to love our enemy even if that means ISIS and to prayer not only for the souls of the persecuted but also the persecutor.\", 'I did attend mass this weekend, however the priest was more focused on the awful events that occurred over the past week and did not mention anything about the election/candidates. To my recollection he has never really spoken about politics in general. I would like to hear the priest urge parishioners to consider their options and weigh them through Catholic lenses. Reiterate what the church teaches (especially about marriage and abortion) and use that info to make a moral choice.', 'I was not able to go to services this Sunday which I was upset about. Our Priest is not very political at all and really he speaks of nothing about the campaign. Since I live outside of Orlando, FL our Priest spends a lot of time talking about the mass killing at the Pace night club and all the hate in the world. I would like to hear him talk about how the candidates need to talk more about family values and more tolerance needs to be done. I know our Priest does talk from time to time about the abortion issue and gay marriage which I have a hard time coming to grips with as I know it may be wrong but people should be able to make their own choices.', 'My priests do not talk directly about the presidential race or the candidates.  They talk about the issues and what our faith says about those issues.  They encourage us to make faith based decisions but do not name candidates or parties.  It is about voting for our beliefs more than for a person.  As such nothing about the tone has been mentioned.  I would not want my priest talking about the candidates or the election.  They are there for guidance in faith, not to take political stances.', \"I normally do not attend religious services regularly.  I did on Sunday just for this purpose.  Unfortunately, the priest never mentioned the presidential race.  The sermon was about the unrest and killings in this country at the present time.  To be honest I don't any religious leader should preach about who we should vote for.  I am sure they are for Donald Trump because of his position on Pro-life.  They are very closed minded and feel that all their congregation should feel the same.\", \"While not directly addressed in this week's sermon, the message was about finding and having hope in an uncertain future.  I can certainly see how that message could be translated to the current political environment we find ourselves in.  I am not generally a negative person, but the current state of affairs generally, and the political environment specifically, has caused a ripple in my thinking.  I am grateful for a spiritual advisor who can help me reframe my thinking and provide a historical and biblical context for times such as our happening in the past.  I am hopeful that whatever the outcome, that it will be for our good. [You are grateful when a spiritual advisor who can help you be reflective? Where do you draw the line for a spiritual advisor?] I always look forward to being able to interact with clergy of my church on a weekly basis.  It's easy to become mired in the day-to-day process of living life, and with all the negativity swirling around us, I have a real appreciation for the. 30,000-foot view of our world and the way we can go about living our lives.  As far as spiritual advising goes, outside of those positions within the church is where I draw the line.  It becomes very easy to confuse spiritual guidance with biased opinion, especially with those who may not have credentials or an ambiguous background. (Male)\", 'My pastor did not talk about the election but did talk about the country needing to come together to support and help those that are less fortunate and not judge individuals based on life circumstances but be filled with love and giving for all individuals. My pastor has not mentioned the election at all but has covered topics that seem to be associated such as personal attacks and trying to separate the country and create a divide. His talking about these aspects has made me realize exactly how much I will not vote for trump and that I will do anything in my power in order to make sure nobody I know will bode for him either by presenting information to them (Male)', 'This Sunday the pastor did not talk about anything I felt related to presidential election in a direct or clear way. In the past though I have heard topics discussed behind the pulpit in regards more to specific policies rather than the election or specific politicians. However, I have listened to a handful of panel discussions with Pastor\\'s I respect and admire, who in that setting, are far more willing to call out both candidates by name, and call out their different policies directly. As far as tone is concerned the closest statement I have heard to that came from John Piper who said something along the lines of \"We have one candidate in Clinton who wants to act like we don\\'t have a problem, and we have one in Trump who paints with a broad problem, and both are dangerous!\" Otherwise I have heard little specifically about the tone in the congregations I am involved with. (Male)', 'So, with the service I attended here in town, the pastor actually discussed The Golden Rule and combined that a little bit with the presidential election; he didn\\'t really get too deep or specific. He discussed both Trump and Clinton when speaking. I appreciate honesty from someone I trust, so I would welcome my pastor to discuss how faith plays a part in politics. However, some might not feel the same, so he has to walk this thin line. However, he and I have discussed faith in politics a few times before for a brief moment. My pastor has discussed the Presidential race before, but only briefly. He typically does not get too specific. It is normally more of a generic reference in stating the candidate\\'s name--not what he or she did or is doing. This is more or less how he has approached discussing the Presidential race. He talks about how important it is to have faith in politics. Without the Lord, we are not complete. He has made the statement in the past about how Trump appears non-Christian due to the name calling, but said it is not his call to question someone\\'s faith. It hasn\\'t really impacted my thoughts on the campaign. Of course, I take consideration into what my pastor says, but I form my own thoughts about issues. [Why would you welcome the discussion? Where do you believe the line should be drawn] I would welcome the discussion, because politics is one of those topics that is critically important to talk about superficially. I would draw the line where the pastor would bring his or her views and \"push\" them on others. (Male)', \"My pastor's sermon was focused on the teaching that we are called to be merciful to others as God has been merciful to us. I believe this quality of mercy is something that is important to me in deciding who I chose to vote for. Currently, I don't think many of the candidates have been merciful at all. My pastor has not talked about the Presidential race in the past. There has been no mention of the tone. [How would you feel if your pastor did talk about the race or anything that related to the race?] I would be a bit concerned. I think the pastor's main role is to proclaim the Scriptures. The Scriptures certainly apply to the election but I don't think they need to bring up the specific election issues. (Male)\", \"I wasn't able to attend, but my grandma visited my office this morning and I asked her what the sermon was about. She said it was about loving thy neighbor. I go to a very traditional church (wish we had something a bit more modern around) and they never really tie in current events with the sermons. However, I think this does apply to the situation involving cops shooting black people and then others retaliating. It doesn't have much to do with the election, but it does focus on loving everyone. My pastor doesn't talk about the election. He tends to keep politics out of his sermon (again, relating back to the fact that current events are hardly ever brought into the sermons.) I wish I had a better answer for you on this, but that's all I've got. [Hello, why do you believe current events are not brought up into the sermons? What is traditional about your church?] Everything is traditional. It's hard to explain. It's very old-school. We still sing the same old hymns our of a hymnal over and over again. We follow the same setup almost every week. Real life situations are never brought into the sermons so that's why current events are not discussed. It literally just focuses on scripture in the Bible...not how it applies to our lives or anything. I went to a Lutheran school until high school and that's really where I learned the most as far as adapting scripture into real life situations. My church just doesn't do that. I don't know their reasoning. (Female)\", 'It was interesting. This Sunday, the scriptures were about honesty. This actually led to the discussion of the presidential race. We see Trump as being honest because he is out in the open, but Hilary can keep a secret. Being able to keep a secret is not a good thing when it comes to running for president. We, the people, would not know what is going on in our own nation. I think that it made me feel really good knowing that my pastor was behind me on who I favor for the presidential election. The actual tone was not mentioned, but only because we moved topics rather quick before anything got heated. (Female)', 'I was unable to attend church this weekend. I was on duty here at the fire station. I honestly prefer when the pastor does not try to directly tell the church who to vote for. I prefer that they teach the bible. If I am a faithful follower, then I should be able to discern the best candidate for me. Our pastor has mentioned the race and his belief that it is an important one. He spoke about how important it was that we should all vote, but has never mentioned either candidates name. His only instruction is to vote for our convictions. (Male)', 'Our pastor has yet to discuss the Presidential election, but has done so in the past, saying that both parties need to reach a middle ground of compromise, so as to bring unity to the election process. He also feels that the entire tone is an unfriendly one, not in keeping with the spirit of brotherhood that MLK and other faith leaders have mentioned in similar eras. I happen to agree with him that people need to speak more compassionately and work for a sense of brotherhood. (Male)', \"The pastor did not say much that was relevant to the Presidential election this past Sunday. It's pretty rare that the subject of politics comes up during the sermons at my church. I can recall, however, that at some point around the time that it became clear who the candidates would be, the pastor commented on the uncertainty surrounding the election. His point was not to be distraught by circumstances like this, which I would say is an implication that the state of the election is a negative one. This didn't really have much of an impact on how I thought about the election, because I already agreed with him. (Male)\", \"I went to church Saturday night. (My church holds services on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings). It was a regular service with worship an a sermon. We were going over a passage from 1 Corinthians. The pastor didn't bring up anything about the presidential election. My church avoids taking sides publicly in such discussions. The passage was about love, so I guess that could be applied to the election season though in terms of all questions about candidates not being civil. But I would never draw that political connection automatically while sitting in a church service. I would not like to hear much about how pastors are considering their faith in the presidential election, not unless they speak in general terms and don't indicate party affiliation. Talking about faith in terms of moral issues is perfectly admissible. Indicating party affiliation while doing so, which is what most pastors have a proclivity to do, is inexcusable. It can alienate people who we want to welcome with loving arms.\", \"My pastor has talked about the presidential race, but not in sermons. Three months ago, our church held a multi-church event hosted by pastors from 5 local churches to talk about politics, faith and political philosophy (Plato), which my organization took part in hosting. All were agreed, although all came from conservative backgrounds, that not indicating party affiliation or candidate affiliation was the only appropriate way to have such a discussion. But there is no discussion of political races on Sunday mornings. My pastor hasn't mentioned anything about the tone of the race since he doesn't really go into that. I don't think anything he had to say about it would change my opinions. He's a close friend of the family, and we're probably on the same page anyway. (Female)\", 'I did attend religious services (Christian Reformed Church) and the pastor didn\\'t say anything that I felt particularly spoke to the upcoming presidential election. It was edifying in my spiritual walk though, and he did affirm and encourage our church despite the \"scary\" news topics and tragedies that have been occurring. This is a new church for me and I am not familiar with him ever speaking on the Presidential race. In fact, I don\\'t have any memories of a pastor preaching on any election. So, I would have to answer no, they haven\\'t mentioned anything about the tone of the Presidential campaign. [Hello, I am unclear about the following portion of your comment, could you please clarify?  \"It was edifying in my spiritual walk though, and he did affirm and encourage our church despite the \"scary\" news topics and tragedies that have been occurring.\"  Also, you state you do not have any recollection of pastors preaching on any presidential election. What is your preference if they do or not?] The pastor\\'s topic of preaching and encouraging his congregation was not to ignore the tragedies that have been happening (the shootings in Orlando and Dallas for instance) but instead was to proclaim that though evil happens the world still belongs to God.   My preference is that a pastor does not preach on the presidential election. No one in authority should persuade voters or be in a position to potentially persuade so as not to open the door to corruption. (Female)', 'Our pastor has talked in some capacity but the election. Mostly just focusing on principles about how to be a good citizen in the country and that voting is important. They have not mentioned much about specific candidates. They have specifically said that the tone of the election is hostile. I agree. (Female)', 'I was unable to attend a service this weekend, due to work, but I have had a service that was centered around the election and its tone. My pastor was deeply concerned with the state the countries well-being if it had come down to Trump or Hillary, which we now know it has been decided. Just like what I believe the rest of the congregation felt, no one wanted those candidates. The pastor made note of the different races and different financial standings that have come together for God and worship in our church, and that there should be any walls or boundaries for all human kind. He then asked us if we elected one of these candidates to think about how different the United States will be. Will other religions be persecuted, will races be discouraged and beaten down, and will the financially unable be turned away at a time of need? This did shape the way I view the candidates to a certain degree, it made me think about their character and if they can morally and physically be beneficial to this country. (Female)', \"We were told last week that we would have a time of prayer at each service over what has been going on in the country racially. As soon as our pastor got on stage, he said that political parties won't solve our problems. Only prayer will help. He invited police officers on stage and he and an African American man prayed over them and our country. Our pastor prayed for the things that divide us to unite us. He prayed that we would be Jesus with skin on and show kindness. That goes for politics as well. We need to come together as one nation. In the past, I can't remember our main pastor or any of the other staff who have spoken to bring up the election. There are a few local politicians who go to our church, and our pastor has talked about them and had them stand up before. (The mayor and a man who is now a state representative are examples.) [Hi Sarah, do you remember in what context these politicians were talked about? How do you see this kind of interaction? Appropriate or not?] The mayor is very involved in the community events we do, so he is well known by our staff. The state representative was in our pastor's group when he was a youth pastor. They have known each other for over 20 years. Our pastor has never told us to go vote for them but he acknowledges that they go to our church, so I think it is ok.\", 'Our pastor has not said a lot specifically about the presidential race, but he has said a lot about the direction our country is headed in the way of politics. Yesterday in the sermon he did briefly recap the current events of the week, beginning with the 4th of July and the reason we celebrate was because of religion. The first settlers came to America because of religion and they felt religion in Europe was going the wrong direction. He went on to talk about Trump suing a hat company for making hats not fully made in the US, and then talked about the news of Clinton was careless with her email but had not done anything worth criminal charges. From there he moved on into his topic of the sermon.', \"I did manage to go to church and the sermon was on how to remain faithful to God. Part of remaining faithful to God is to rely on his kingdom to fix all the problems that we're facing. I don't believe that any of the problems we face can actually be fixed by a human ruler. I certainly don't believe that God is involved in the election. I don't think he favors one over the other. I believe that Jesus made it clear that his kingdom was no part of this world. In any case the sermon had nothing to do with the election and I was not influenced when where the other on how to vote. If I could hear anything from pastors about the political process, I guess I would like to hear they're genuine personal opinion. I want to know how they feel as human beings and not paid political shills because I do feel that there is some agenda behind their words at this point. I am sure that they did not appear on this commercial free of charge, now did they? I don't even know who any of those people are so I have no reason to believe them. But anyway I would encourage everyone to speak frankly and express their opinions honestly and that's what I'm interested in listening to no matter who is speaking. And that is what is so crazy and ironic here can't you see? That's what I like about Trump.  he says what he thinks. He doesn't worry about what other people are going to think or the political costs. He's not calculated and scripted. Anyway I have spoken frankly myself throughout this study and I believe that you get the idea of where I'm coming from. Do you have any questions I'll be more than happy to explain my position further?\", 'Our pastor did not mention anything particularly political in nature at all with regards to American culture. This is likely due in part to his awareness of the separation of church and state as well as the fact that his family is Slovak and he is generally asking for prayers for them and others who are affected by what Russia is doing. I wish that our pastor WOULD talk about the race as I am really in a quandary as to who to vote for and it would help to have a theological take on both candidates separately. As for other things, he DID reference the recent killing of police officers in Dallas Texas and that made me think that more security for political events and rallies might be a good idea.', \"And that we need a president who understands need for more bulletproof vests and helmets for ALL our public safety staff ACCROSS the USA. He did mention that we should be praying for the gunman and the police officers in Dallas he killed (at the Black Lives Matter rally). He only referenced it and did not make any specific remarks about it, just that it was a terrible tragedy. Father Val more often than not just asks us to pray for these events. He may have personal beliefs about presidential candidates, but I have never heard him express any of his view.  He has not mentioned the presidential race or its tone at all.  for this reason, there has been no effect on my thoughts or beliefs about the campaign from church a way. But I know after church at the social hour people talk. [I understand you wish for your pastor to talk about the race, how would you want him to do this? What do you feel is appropriate or not?] I think it's appropriate to speak about what characteristics we should look out for or want to see in a candidate without specifying names euphemisms tic references to actual candidates or political parties. I mean sometimes it's helpful to hear the values of a third party. And it doesn't have to be a list of polarizing views but it's good to hear what spiritual leaders are putting out there as standards for us to seek in our candidates. I don't feel it is appropriate for pastor to say who they are voting for or tell us a specific candidate is good or bad.\", \"This Sunday I did attend a service that I haven't been in a very long time. The pastor was talking about the trouble that has been going on this past week. It is a very scary time in the USA. My heart is heavy with all the hate in this world. He spoke on how we need to forgive the shooter and the killing of those two black men. He also spoke on how if Mr. Trump had his way this would become our new normal. That's scares me to death. He also said that we need to be prepared for the worst. Mr. Trump has so much to learn about compassion, and about forgiveness and for us to pray for him.\", \"Our pastor did not say anything in this sermon regarding the presidential race, he spoke mainly about building family and the shootings of the past week. He has mentioned the race in the past and has done a sermon series about servant leadership. The congregation prayed for our future leaders. I don't know if I would want to hear my pastor's views on politics, at least not from the pulpit. That seems to run the risk of being judgmental. He has not said anything about the tone.\", \"My pastor had not talked about the candidates specifically, but he has mentioned the tone of the campaign. Mostly joking about how difficult it is to find someone worth voting for. It hadn't impacted my thoughts about the campaign.\", 'I attended a service yesterday, and no mention of the presidential race. Why? Because politics should never be mentioned in church. We don\\'t go to \"politic house\" to worship politicians on Sundays, we go to church to worship God. If my church talks about the campaign, the tone of the campaign, or expresses pro-trump or pro-Hillary ideas I will walk out and not return. Just sayin.', \"When I went to Mass yesterday almost all of the service was about the tragedy that happened in Dallas. Not much was said about the presidential race, it kind of took a back seat to Dallas. It wouldn't matter to me if my Priest said anything bad about Donald Trump because my mind is made up and he is who I'm voting for. I would never vote for Hillary Clinton after what the FBI said about her. [Hello, what specifically about the FBI turns you completely away from Clinton? I understand that it would not matter to you if the Priest discussed the election, but what is your position if you did not know who you were voting for?] the FBI investigated her actions with the emails and ruled they weren't going to indicate. her. this made me mad. if she is that careless with top secret information I believe she would be careless as president. plus, she is going to owe a lot of people favors and it's going to be Obama all over again. she should of been held responsible for her actions. I still believe in Donald Trump; he is the best of the two running.\", \"During our church service, the pastor was preaching from I Timothy, God's good goal for the church, chapter 6. He did not say anything specificity about the election. What I would like to hear is what he's already said - that it's more important to not get into fights with people over these issues. He has not said anything specifically about the issues or the candidates of the election. He has made general references to the tone of the election indicating how sad it is that things have degenerated to the level that they have. What he said only confirmed what I was already thinking.\", \"My pastor has not talked specifically about the Presidential races, but a couple of months ago, he did speak about the plight of the immigrants, the ones Donald Trump has spoken about turning away.  In a roundabout way, I believe that was his way of pointing out the flaws in Trump's beliefs without endorsing one candidate. There has not, however, been any discussion or sermon about the upcoming election. We did attend services this past weekend. The sermon did not tie in with the election or the candidates' tone. As far as what I would like to hear from our pastors and how their faith guides them, I think it would be nice for them to tie in Biblical passages with the candidate’s viewpoint on some issues. I mentioned earlier about welcoming Muslim immigrants into our country but as a church, we've heard about the views on gay marriage and Planned Parenthood. I believe those are important issues to be addressed and to have scriptures to confirm our beliefs as they relate to each candidate (and what they represent) would be helpful in these conflicted times.\", \"The minister has not talked about the presidential campaign or past or present. [Hello, why do you think your minister has not talked about presidential elections, past or present? Do you prefer this or not?] My pastor says to pray for the nation and that we need to pray for the upcoming election.  I guess in that way he talks about the election. I agree with him that we need to pray for our nation. FYI I live in Philly but all of my family lives in Colorado, (where I'm from originally).  Therefore, we don't attend the same church but I will be going to Colorado next week so I'm going to talk to my family about the election.  I usually try to avoid politics because we don't usually see things the same way.\", 'Is this purely a Hate-Trump forum? Why so many \"when did you stop beating your wife\" questions to corner me into hating Trump? Both of these candidates are horribly flawed. But you only seem focused on exposing that about one of them, and are ignoring the other. Hillary, is that you on the other end of this gizmo? Have a nice day. Please repent and try to be honest. Thanks.', 'My only thoughts on this are that several of these verses are often taken out of context. I personally would not think of any of these verses when deciding on who to vote for. The one verse I do think of when voting is Romans 13:1 which says no one is in authority except those appointed by God. This leads me to pray about who I should vote for. [Why would you not think of these verses when deciding who to vote for? How are they taken out of context?] To fully understand a verse, it is important to understand what context it is in. I can\\'t see the verses now, and I don\\'t remember all of them, but for example the one on mercy, is right in the middle of the Beatitudes, which is actually a small piece of the sermon on the mount. (3 chapters long). There was one from Proverbs, which is usually ok to take just one verse and apply it since a lot of the book is simply short proverbs to live by. Another one was the Golden Rule which is also a part of the sermon on the Mount but a couple chapters after the Beatitudes. Why not use the entire sermon on the mount to judge how Trump is doing as a person? But, in the same sermon on the mount we are told not to judge others. Therefore, none of the verses given would be something I would consider when voting for a president. I would love to have a Christian president in office, but I\\'m not sure when the last time was that we had a Christian president. Probably not in my lifetime, although most claim to be Christians just as Trump does. Clinton claimed to be a Christian, but yet had an affair while in the Whitehouse. If a candidate claims to be a Christian, the first thing I will look for is if his or her lifestyle honors God. If it does not, then I know it is just another \"American Christian\" and I look at other things when deciding who to vote for. Remembering that no matter what, whoever gets into office gets there as part of God\\'s sovereign plan.', 'ke in our last session, please imagine you are at lunch with a friend who is a person of faith who gives you the following reasons to vote against Donald Trump. Please rank the top three statements that concern you the most about Donald Trump and discuss the reasons you choose those statements. Also, tell us what you would say in response to your friend about the ones you choose and any that do not concern you.', '\"I choose this statement: Donald Trump wants to be President, the face of America and a role model to our children, but he routinely calls people names, brags and lashes out in anger. We are constantly telling our children to set good examples, and never to bully or tolerate being bullied.  Here we are faced with a presidential candidate that does nothing but bully and speak poorly to and about people. I can tell you exactly what I\\'d say to a friend because this conversation has taken place on many occasions.  I say, whether or not you like, voted, or support President Obama, he is a man of character.  He is the face of our nation and he is a good role model.  He acts in a \"\"presidential manner\"\" that is nothing but respectful and compassionate.  He is a family man, he treats his wife and daughter\\'s with respect.  He does not bully people or slander them in the public eye.  He carries himself in a poised, controlled manner. \"', '\"First off, all these statements concern me about Trump. Number 1 Donald Trump wants to be President, the face of America and a role model to our children, but he routinely calls people names, brags and lashes out in anger.... I think this one is a biggie because I believe the President needs to be level-headed. He is not. He always feels ready to attack. He is always on guard. Sometimes you need to sit and reflect on situations. He doesn\\'t seem very capable of doing that. Plus, I think he would have a hard time listening to advice from advisers.', 'I think the first statement pretty well says it all.  He has continuously made fun of people.  He has no tolerance for anyone different from him.  Everyone else is wrong.  Our country is already in turmoil and by him spewing all this hate is only making it worse.  He is a role model for no one.  I cannot understand how intelligent people think he is Presidential material.', \"Donald Trump wants to be President, the face of America and a role model to our children, but he routinely calls people names, brags and lashes out in anger. This is my second concern about Trump because a prideful person has a lot of secrets and insecurities that would make me hesitant in thinking of their capabilities to run a country. It makes him appear egotistical and narcissistic to where only his ideas and concerns matter. I'm not saying to be a role model you have to reach everyone on a positive level because not everyone will be tuned in to that idea but you have to at least be positive to a majority of viewers. If your whole demeanor is coming off abrasive, then you are losing that majority of people who want you to lead them.\", '\"I chose this point because I feel it is important to be the example not the problem, especially when you are trying to take on a position of power such as this. Trump portrays himself in such a poor light.  He is not so much of a Christian man as ever when he displays such behavior. He is not setting a good example for our future generations. He is basically telling them it is ok to act like this. That it is ok to disrespect women, and make fun of people with disabilities, and have affairs. He is a terrible role model\"', \"Donald Trump seems to be an intelligent man. He wouldn't have made it this far in the business world if he wasn't intelligent. He must know that calling people names, mocking people, and brags in a negative way. He must know that these behaviors would impact his presidential campaign negatively, but he just won't control himself. This is scary. It tells me that he reacts emotionally without thinking, and that sort of behavior will be devastating for a nation let by somebody like that with that sort of power. This is exactly what I would tell a friend. I'm not bashful about speaking my mind about this to a true friend. (Female)\", \"Again this does not concern or bother me. Again I find it refreshing to find someone who is not concerned what the PC police are going to say.

NO ONE should stand for someone calling them names and making fun of them.

Aside from multiple marriages he has been accused of lying about his investment school and cheating people out of their money, he had lied about business deals plus he is not at all honest about his net worth.

Trump has little common sense.', \"It is appalling to see a leader and representative demean the sanctity of human life.  I was unaware that he had acted in such a repulsive manner until I saw a television ad against him. I find it deplorable that he had the nerve to behave such a way and in public for all to see and witness.  He should have apologized if he hadn't and work towards uplifting the human spirit rather than tearing it down.  As an example, Michael Vick, a famous football quarterback was sent to prison for endorsing dog fighting and animal abuse. As part of his social justice and community service program he focused on volunteering and donating funds to help animal rights activism.  Donald Trump should be focusing on the same for disabled people by donating time, effort, money, etc. to uphold their cause and dignity in order to make up for his senseless behavior and insulting antics.\", '\"Third: Donald Trump has mocked a disabled reporter for his disability. We need someone in the White House who respects the dignity of people like the disabled, not someone that insults them. I choose this because, I have a child with special needs and this is appalling that a person, let alone a presidential candidate would make fun of someone.   Along the same lines as my previous answers, this is awful.  What kind of role model, nation\\'s leader would say such a horrible thing?  He is not a role model that I want my children or myself to have to look up to.  anyone who can disrespect so many people just because they are different should not be in charge of the country.

Even if I ever was thinking of voting for him that would have stopped me.  He is such an egomaniac.

In fact, they really don't. But I know you want comments on this so I will try to do my best and give you something to work with. I'll tell you why it doesn't bother me. I am tired of people who are afraid to say anything because they will be criticized for being not politically correct. Even if something is offensive. It is refreshing to see someone who will say what's on his mind and does not care what other people think. As I have said many times during the course of this study, I am not looking for moral leader and a president. It doesn't concern me. All I want is president who can help the economy because we're broke. If people wanted to elect someone who was a Christian, then the primary system would have produced a Christian candidate. But it did not. So there you go. The people have spoken!\", \"This is another hot topic that most people find concerning. Donald Trump didn't so much as call for a ban as he did wanting to put a stall on things until the government could put together a better screening process. I don't see anything wrong with this, but a ton of people do. I definitely think there should be a better screening process all around.

Thus, I will copy the statement and then add my comments. 1)Donald Trump wants to be President, but doesn’t show respect for women. He has routinely criticized women for their appearances and weight, and made crude sexual comments. We need a President who respects others, doesn’t treat them with disrespect. Donald Trump\\'s actions, regarding lack of respect for others is a big concern for me. How can a leader of free world behave like this? I used to think he was kidding, but more and more he shows that he does not respect anyone. This is the most critical statement in my opinion. Donald Trump does not live up to American values, let alone Christian values. He does not support religious freedom, which was a founding ideal of America.\"', 'This statement concerns me the most because I am fearful of banning anyone based on religious reasons. That is so close to persecution, and that can be turned on Christians too.

All these people want to do is be safe and work hard, just like the rest of us. They should not be penalized for that. I want us to continue to allow people to come here and feel accepted. I really feel that Trump is using people\\'s fear to gain votes and that is not right.\"', 'The least concerning statement to me is about him getting remarried after an affair during his first marriage. I am already aware that he is not a Christian nor a good man. However, many men have messed up at some point in their lives. While this is not ok, it is not a main concern of mine when it comes to his ability to run a country. Quite frankly many politicians seem to philander.', 'Donald Trump says he is a Christian, but he has not behaved that way in his personal life. He is on his third marriage and ended his first marriage because he was having an affair with his second wife. The only statement that I feel like doesn’t concern me is the one about his personal life.  It’s really none of my business that he’s been married three times or that he cheated on his wife.  Is it reprehensible?  Yes, but it isn’t a factor in whether I would vote for him or not.  No.', \"Donald Trump says he is a Christian, but he has not behaved that way in his personal life. He is on his third marriage and ended his first marriage because he was having an affair with his second wife. I don't like this statement, primarily because of bringing Christianity into it, but it doesn't concern me. I don't care how many marriages the man has had.

The fact of divorce on the other hand has become so common in the United States that it is seemed at normal. Now I am not condoning divorce, but I do understand the reasoning behind it. Trump on the other hand has no reasoning behind his actions, only the fact that he liked the new shiny Barbie. Though his marriage record and his personal life, has no place in the campaign for his presidency. \" (Female)', \"I'm going to comment on the comments he makes about women. I believe Trump is a feminist. I don't think he has any problem with women. I think he loves women. I also think that his wife and his daughter will help him to shape policies that will be beneficial and effective for women. As for the name calling comma again I find it refreshing to hear someone who does not Candor, and who is not scripted. Well some of his comments May offend others, I feel that they are refreshing and truthful nature outweighs the negative aspect. As for the immigrants. Well. I don't have the answers to that. I don't know what should be done with all these immigrants. All I know is that my middle-class existence has disappeared and I'm very concerned about that. I need to take care of my family here, and worry about them, not a bunch of immigrants who are not even my religion. I don't understand why we are expected to fix everybody's problems. Can we just fix America's problems first and then deal with letting all kinds of people in?  The bottom line is that this does not affect me directly and therefore I don't care.\", \"Trump clearly has his frailties as any other person in the public eye, his marriage record, his inability to censor himself at times and say things that are not so politically correct with regards to women or the disabled press person, but honestly, sometimes he just says what everyone else is thinking but not willing to say out loud. Basically, I feel like Trump is pretty transparent and what we see is what we get. I kind of like that. Whereas Hillary, has a different persona. I see Hillary as a politician who has made secret deals behind closed doors, she will say and do whatever she has to get elected. I expect that there were payoffs in the past, cover ups when people mysteriously died or (killed themselves or had accidents) and payoffs and cover ups regarding her failure to use proper protocols regarding classified emails and then there was her blatant lying about events she supposedly experienced while in the Middle East when she was not a party to those events. She's just slimy.\", \"1 - Hillary has a mouth worse than a sailor, they just hide it for her. 2 - Women interviewed who worked for Trump all say wonderful things about him. 3 - Mocking a disabled person? Really? You are grasping at straws. I am the mother of a 36-year-old disabled person and I am not offended. 4 - Donald Trump does not live up to American values? Is his long-time-personal aide the offspring of renowned Muslim Brotherhood people (weiners wife)? That's just a starting statement. Don't want to waste too much effort cuz you are a brick wall anyway.\", \"I feel it says things I have already heard. I listen to the Pope's speeches whenever possible. I have great respect for Him. He makes a lot of sense and I value what he has to say. This video shows a very big difference between what the Pope says and what Trump says. It is like two opposites. I think this video is enlightening to who Trump really is.\", \"I've heard all of the references highlighted in the video and while I agree with Pope Francis I believe the non-Catholic world will not view it well.  I can already hear the references of the Pope trying to sway our election.  The other thing that would concern me is that candidates other than Trump would use these clips to their benefit.  I hold our Pope in high esteem and would hate to see that happen.\", 'It seems very contrived to make Trump seem even worse than he is. [Hi, what made you believe the video made Trump seem even worse than he is?] Dying get me wrong, I feel that Trump is terrible. But this video specifically took quotes of his and pitted then against the Pope. You could do this just as successfully with any candidate or any person. Context and making are needed to understand what was being said and why.', 'I think the pope is the kind of person the world needs more of, but unfortunately there are more people like Trump. The pope wants to break down walls that separate people and Trump wants to build walls to keep them out.', \"It led me warmer to Trump just because of how overly edited it was on both Trump and the Pope's statements. This was definitely a gorilla style ad to scare the weak and I hope with how much the media is flooded with scare tactics that people will look further online for the full statements and truth.\", 'Much cooler.  I never saw that speech where he says you have to be wealthy in order to be great.  That is really scary for someone to think like that.  If he becomes President I feel sorry for all us middle class and poor people.  Next he will build a wall around us.  It is pretty evident when he mentions the wall he is referring to Mexicans; He always picks on the people least able to defend themselves.', 'Colder if that is possible towards Trump with his statement about having to be wealthy to be great. Trump is such a snob as he just degraded all the teachers, poets, labors and every American with a statement like that. What has Trump ever done that is great other then decimate the land with buildings?', 'I am disappointed at times in the statements and behavior of Trump.  I do not believe that he should make outrageous statements as those shown in the video regarding mistakes and wealth.  Nevertheless, the video is one sided depicting Trump at his worst.  The Pope is a respected religious leader that needs to examine the issues that I presented and stop shaming a political candidate and stick to religious matters.', 'I guess my only confusion is why is this video necessary.  The media has widely publicized this information so why combine all of these particular clips.  I almost feel like this will be used against the Trump campaign and thus using our beloved Pope as a tool in this election.  I\\'m not sure I agree with that. [What role/tool do you see the Pope playing in the election? How should he go about changing peoples\\' opinions?] Hi Nikki - I don\\'t believe he should play a role in the election.  Nor do I believe Joel Osteen or T.D. Jakes should.  When political leaders become actively involved in elections I believe it can divide churches/congregations.  I have family members who are strong Trump supporters as well as some adamant Clinton supporters.  All of them are Catholic.  The non-Trump supporters use what the Pope has said to support their Hillary agenda.  This type of thinking can divide the Church if anyone feels like they must follow the Pope\\'s lead on who to support in an election.    Are you asking how he should go about changing peoples\\' opinion on a particular candidate?  I don\\'t think he should.  He should just speak the truth and not make comments like \"then he is not a Christian\".  If he had left that one comments out I would have been okay with everything else.  If you are asking generally how he can change peoples\\' opinion on civility, mercy, and loving one’s neighbor as themselves, then he should keep promoting civility, acceptance, and love in general.  He should teach them by showing them just as he has been doing.  He is not living an extravagant lifestyle as other Popes have.  He is one of us and is very open to say so.  Actions like this make us embrace him as well as others of different religions.  I have even had acquaintances who are atheist say they like what he has to say.  Maybe by the Pope being humble and accepting it allows those who are not believers to embrace his teaching and ultimately becoming believers.', \"I question why the Pope is being used in political campaign advertisements. I really take offense when a religious leader such as the respected and learned Pope Francis interferes with the political system.  Is there not separation of church and state?  Do we not take religion out of public schools? Are we not allowed to pray in public schools or mention religion without including all other religions?  I feel that if the Pope is trying to sway my opinion he is doing it in the wrong manner. [Hello. I understand you believe the Pope is going about changing your opinion in the wrong manner. What role do you see the Pope playing in the election? How should he go about changing peoples' opinions?] I think that the Pope has a right to speak about change, issues and the Church's values; however, I think that if he is going to speak about it he must also be a proponent of the change.  He should lay out a plan to make that change.  I think in the case of Donald Trump he needs to state that he would like to work with him on devising a way to treat people more fairly.  Perhaps he could suggest some sort of joint initiative from the Trump camp and the Vatican to perform an act of mercy.  Trump ran a fundraiser for Veterans, why not get together with the Pope and have them match $ for $ towards feeding the hungry in the US or holding a benefit for another underprivileged group that needs assistance and deem this as taking care of your neighbor. I think it would wise to have Trump meet with religious leaders and display good character.  We are used to Donald Trump displaying inappropriate behavior, yet in no way do I approve of it. I felt that the Pope displayed inappropriate behavior without follow up on how to turn Donald Trump around.  Trump is a viable force to be reckoned with not dismissed.  If anyone could propose change in a feasible manner it could be the Pope because he is so well liked and respected.  Have him use that charisma and insight to fine tune Donald Trump so that he could be an appropriate solution for failing America?\", \"I think his multiple marriages should be brought up. [Why do you believe Trump's multiple marriages should have been brought up] Well his first marriage collapsed because he was unfaithful with Marla. His first wife and Marla had a very public argument on the slopes of Aspen, when his wife discovered he had brought his Mistress along on a family Christmas vacation.   I just feel that if people knew that he does not hold his family and wedding vows as sacred, that would show what type of person he is.   He has declared bankruptcy as many times as he has been married.\", \"Yes! The full statements of both people. And how about the Pope's apology that he shouldn't have made the statement in the first part or Trump's remarks back to the Pope. [The suggestions you made, how would they change the video and your feelings about it?] I feel if the video wasn't chopped up and recorded with the responses it wouldn't have such a one sided message. The video's message would change and display a more realistic approach of both people and not so much of a scare tactic. If both parties could be accurately portrayed, I think it would leave the audience with less tension and confusion from the original video showed. However, in today's society, media outlets thrive off that scare tactic behavior to scare rather then inform the public so I don't ever see how a video or message would be displayed accurately.\", \"Yes, there was something missing, objectivity. I did not see the statements that the Pope made later on taking back his statements about Donald Trump.  I believe that Pope reissued a statement after there was outcry from many stating that the Pope needs to stay out of the politics of the United States.  Perhaps he can concentrate on the politics of keeping fraud out of the Vatican banking system. As I have stated before, if the Pope cared about turning Trump around then he should have met with him in a private manner and had an advisory session with him. [How would the reissued statement made by the Pope change your opinion and feelings about the video? Why is this statement important?] I would have seen a different side of the Pope, him admitting that he needed to adjust his statement. I think that this would have made the video seem not as slanted towards one side.  I think that I would not have been so critical of the Pope if this had been displayed. I also would have liked to have seen Trump's responses to both dialogues by the Pope. I think the statement made by the Pope clarifies to the public that there is a bigger picture that needs to be examined. This is sensationalism and there is always more to the story than meets the eye.\", \"More context to all the statements. [Hi Rebecca. What context do you believe was missing?] It gives 3 second clips of whatever goes against what the Pope was saying. I have no idea what he was saying those things in reference to or even if this was a poorly chosen moment of sarcasm. The video takes what it wants and gives us nothing else. These sorts of things are scary with how Easy it is for them to mislead people into thinking whatever the producer wanted them to even if it's the opposite of true. I happen to believe this particular one does represent Trump accurately but the format bothers me.\", 'Everything important was left out and this just saddens me to know America\\'s media is being funded on misinformation and chopped up broadcasting because it\\'s the scare tactics that feed into the insecurities of our citizens. Another perfect example is Orsen Welles radio broadcast of \"War of the Worlds\" where actual foolish people committed suicide because of the broadcast. I\\'m thankful to live in a technology based day where social media is the driving force of getting truth spread.', 'I wished that the Pope had stated that he wanted to arrange a meeting with Trump to discuss how the 2 could work together to iron out plans of compromise.  I wish that the Pope who started the conversation had stated that he wanted to work with Trump on building bridges via politics instead of tearing him down. Yes, Trump could have turned around and asked for a meeting too to work on a plan to settle these areas; however, I do not think that a religious leader putting a candidate on the spot is appropriate.', \"I thought that this video was overtly preachy and it stung. well I myself do not care for all of Donald Trump's policies, I found this video and nothing more than your average political smear campaign; mudslinging. As human beings, let alone Christians and other believers, it is not our place to judge Mr. Trump. No one's got a perfect existence, and bigotry isn't a crime, merely bothersome to certain populace.

To some I'm sure that would be the opinion I think if we had a crew of cameras and videos and were allowed access as a fly on the wall of Hillary’s house or hotel or conference rooms or the backseat of her limos.... I imagine we would see an interesting side of Hillary, but with Trump, what you see is what you get. I've never heard Trump profess to be a born again Christian so I don't think we can hold him to Christian values.\", 'I agree with the verse \"that all have fallen short of the glory of God\" and agree that all need to repent. This video is uncomfortable to watch and makes me wish even more that Ted Cruz could have been the nominee. It is hard to accept that I have to choose between the two candidates that are left because neither make a strong case for Christianity.  But, I also know I cannot sit out the election especially in a swing state and allow Hillary Clinton to become President.', 'I didn\\'t like their approach. I hated the way one of the pastors said \"his prayer\" was that Donald Trump would repent. I\\'m sure that\\'s everyone\\'s prayer if the man is not a Christian, but it\\'s so self-righteous to say that in an interview. I think they were right to object to the behaviors they did, that much was valuable. But I didn\\'t like the way the first two went about it. It came off arrogant. The third one, the one talking about immigration, wasn\\'t as bad in terms of being arrogant, but I don\\'t agree that we have a moral responsibility toward any other religious group. We have a moral obligation toward them as humans made in the image of God, not because they are part of another faith. (Female)', \"I found them to be sincere.  I especially found most sincere the pastor who said he would not have said anything if Trump had not identified himself as a Christian. But I do find all of this quite misplaced. This man is the chosen person. There were lots of different Republican people running for office and he beat every one of those people. I'm sorry you don't like him but the people have spoken. This should have this should have all taken place during the primaries. The primaries are over.\", 'I think the pastors were responding to video clips out of context and I may agree with some of what they said, particularly about the need for us to pray for Trump to repent and become a Christian.

[What makes you believe they do not know Trump well enough? What do you want them to know? How could the message about Muslim be communicated better? What would you want to hear?] they only spoke of the negative things about Donald Trump and not of any of the positive things he has done. I would want them to know about his family life, his children and their accomplishments. the children wouldn't be who they are today if Donald Trump didn't raise them right. if he was so bad they would have turned out bad. he had a good childhood and made sure his children did too. he even has grandchildren that he is helping to grow into responsible adults. the Muslim's have to realize when they come to our country they should abide by our rules, if we go to their country we're not allowed to drink and have to dress like them on top of it all. we shouldn't have to change for them, if they want to come here they need to change.\", \"Cooler.

I will do my absolute best to represent it and help to make it a better place for the next generation\"', 'It made me feel cooler because it is all his faults shown in sequentially and it is discouraging to think this is the best we have got.  But, I still trust him vastly more than Clinton and it is not enough by any stretch of the imagination to make me change my voting plan. [What I meant was those times when you have opinions or impressions swirling around in your head concerning something you saw or heard .... What I was referring to for me anyway was when I heard the pastors speak on the video it kinda gave voice to those fragment an of thoughts I had on the subject ... Therefore, it validated my feelings and put it in a cohesive coherent statement] I will not change because I do not trust Clinton and cannot think of a single policy of hers I would support.  Also, I know if she is elected she will appoint very liberal judges and Supreme Court Justices and this is not consistent with my faith.  I have never been overly enthused by Trump and this video was just a reminder of why I have not gotten excited about his candidacy.', \"There was nothing much confusing about the video other than who the affiliation was.

[If the sampling was negative or positive, how would a broader sampling impacted your feelings about the video?] It's hard to say really. My big concern would be that the only religious people who may come out and support Trump would be people at polarizing as he is, which would have as detrimental an effect as he does to himself. That's the worst part of that sort of thing: since people can speak freely about their choice of candidate, they can do as much bad as good. Politics is so polarizing, yet so important.

What would you have wanted included?] Oh there isn't anything in particular I wanted or need to see that wasn't included. I just know from keeping up with the election there are scores of other sound bites from both Trump and other evangelical leaders that could have been applied well here. I always love more visual and audible evidence, but I understand the video was probably intended to be fairly short.   (Male)\", \"No. Right now as I am on this page I cannot watch it again. I will watch it again if I am given the opportunity and I will pay attention this time to who put this out. I'm interested in knowing who's behind it and what the agenda is.

Maybe one of the Koch brothers. All I know is that everybody's got an agenda and no one is innocent and no one is really good.\", \"Maybe more of each interview and debate.  I try not to form an opinion of a candidate based on a couple of soundbites.  Maybe more about where he stood on other issues besides Muslims immigrating. [What other issues would you have liked to see covered? How much more of the interview and debate should be included to feel that there was nothing missing?] Issues like healthcare, the economy, taxes, education, the environment, foreign policy, etc., As for the clips, just a little more of each interview, so it didn't feel so pieced together.\", \"I would have liked to seen a bit more about all of the issues in the video.  Healthcare, economy, security, where he stands on gun control.  As shocking as his statements of faith are, there will be so much more called into question if he wins the presidency. [How would you have wanted these issues covered in the video? How would your feelings about the video changed if they had been included?]  I'm sure there is footage out there somewhere of Trump mentioning at least some of these issues.  Even if they stream some of his tweets during the video it would be something.  I'm not sure that my feelings would change very much, just that I would feel better forming an opinion on more than just a couple examples.\", 'One of the 10 commandments is \" thou shall not bear false witness.

What would need to be done to make the video show the complete conversation?] Well It would be difficult because the actual real time conversations would take up too much time for average commercial, but I was particularly concerned about the quotes from various Christian ministers which I question what else was said in conversation. When the quotes are only one sided about one candidate.... I mean did those same candidates actually fully support Hillary? Or were their reasonable responses regarding Trump just part of a much bigger interview.  It just reminds me of how many times people will quote the Bible as saying \" Money is the root of all evil.\" When they leave out \"The LOVE of\" that actually precedes the quote and REALLY changes its whole meaning.  So I just wonder what was said in the whole interview. Maybe you could show the whole interview as a printed newspaper column and just highlight or embolden the part of the quotes that are being said and, et the viewer judge for themselves.  I thought I explained in my last line of response. I will try again.

[I think it is interesting that you say the video is a kind way to inform voters and drive a point home. How is the video kind? How would have a not kind video looked?] It felt kind in that it didn\\'t make the voter feel stupid for not knowing those things, and in that it didn\\'t \"attack,\" Trump.

Some will tell me to pray on my decision but I also know that I need logic, instinct and a full examination of who can live up to the standards that I attest to when it comes to values and rights that I feel are important for my family and community. I cannot just pray for a sign.  I can listen to the sermons and homilies at mass and have them inspire me to reflect on what I know to be proper and appropriate ways to behave.  However, at the same time I have to look at the hypocrisy of 'man' representing a religion that preaches to treat people one way yet makes its own mistakes in treating people the way I feel Christ would have if he been here with us now. These days my faith is conflicted yet I will persist to work through these internal conflicts as I have in the past, because we are truly human and can make mistakes.
